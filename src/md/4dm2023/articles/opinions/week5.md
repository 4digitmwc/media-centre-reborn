As the mappools were fully released, we will take the insights into the thoughts of mappool selectors for this edition. We are here, featuring **chxu**, one of the mappool selectors from 4 Digit MWC 2023!

First off, thank you for accepting this text interview with us. Even though this is being conducted asynchronously, I believe that this discourse is necessary for more players to appreciate the philosophy of pooling, aside from the easy assumption that mappoolers are simply putting together a bunch of maps they already know. I hope this discussion may also be helpful for the both of you. Let's get started.

## First off, what were your first few experiences in mappooling? How did these experiences shape the way you think about mappooling now?

First of all I would like to give massive shoutouts to Demi for doing 70% of the heavy lifting for 4DM23. In particular he would go out of his way to ensure the pools were of the highest quality possible, even on weeks when he was busy. Now onto the question.

My experience began in late 2020 when I asked to help out with SoL2 pools after getting eliminated in quarterfinals. I didn't contribute much there other than connecting the poolers with Zeta/Biosphere, which led to UNDICI placed in the grand finals pool. Also around that time, Myuka had invited me to pool for a showmatch between 12 of the top players at that time. I only had a week to create a pool, and I at the time thought I had done an excellent job, but most of the prominent poolers thought differently! However, these first few experiences ingrained in me that players really like diversity of songs/maps in the pools over ``safer'' choices that may not offer as much diversity.

## Overall, how do you now approach mappooling and what other factors of the tournament do you consider while mappooling?

I view mappooling as a puzzle where one has to satisfy a bunch of constraints; think of it as a game of KenKen or Minesweeper, but you are also aiming to make the pools as fun and diverse as possible with those constraints. Apart from fun/balance, the main other factor to consider is the average player strength per round. For example if I'm pooling for a national tournament where the top 6 are insanely good relative to the rest of the playerbase then I will not scale things until lategame. 

## Of these factors, what is the most important factor to consider in order to make a "good" pool? How do you implement this in the mappool?

You have to make it interesting for the players, otherwise they won't care about the tournament as much. Of course you need to maintain some coherence for the rounds, but switching up map/song styles between rounds is otherwise a great idea. You also have to choose maps that don't have difficulty supported on a very small part of the song (i.e. difficulty spikes); edits are really helpful for this, although I would caution not to go overboard with them. Implementing such factors poses a formidable challenge - one has to hunt in the osu! database, in Etterna packs, and if there aren't enough novel picks available then custom mappers have to fill in the blanks. Playtesters also comprise an important part of the implementation: it's nigh on impossible to judge how a map plays simply by looking at its patterns! (I call this fact the *tyranny of 4k mania*, and it is highly related to the reason why it's so hard to map in a way that represents the song well.)

## What is your take on the common dichotomy of Pool Balance vs Enjoyability?

Make the pools as enjoyable as you can get away with, while still maintaining balance. Players care a lot less about balance than you think: unless you've got some blatantly unbalanced stuff, every pick will introduce some element of nerves to the player, and what you can control is precisely the enjoyability aspect of it.

**Next up, we have a couple of questions pertaining to the pooling process, which normally includes sourcing for maps (or dumpster diving), editing, and even custom mapping and modding.**

## What is the process of finding tournament-suitable maps, especially maps that not many players will know and/or played?

Depends highly on the category. For rice, I specifically look at Etterna for good picks: the Etterna/StepMania community has been around for far longer, at least enough for good mapping takes to develop. You know that your community is screwed when you're told the most interesting rice map is Fullerene's Peace Breaker. That's rice for you. For LN/hybrid, half of the time the slots will be filled in by custom mappers since there is a shortage of good lategame LN/hybrid on any platform (although newer mappers have come on to the scene to remedy this). You can also get away with a well placed reuse from time to time - this was my strategy for 4DM4, but we're not trying to replicate that this year.

## How do you approach the problem of map repetition and staleness in a tournament setting?

You pick differently! This is usually the most difficult task to implement, since you know players are gonna get tired even seeing the same custom hybrid mapper/Etterna stream charter for each round. For example you could easily fall for the trap of using Skwid streams for every pool - that's Etterna, yes, but it's also repetitive and likely to make players bored. We have already discussed the strategies of (1) Etterna hunting and (2) custom mapping, but there's a third strategy that I have yet to discuss: dumpster diving. That's right - dumpster diving, the act of mass downloading maps from the osu! database in hopes of finding the diamond in the rough. As of now the only person I've seen successfully dumpster dive for good picks from completely unknown mappers is Penguinosity, while the rest of us have to rely on going through specific known mappers to find something. This is an aspect of pooling that I hope can be optimized one day - I can envision an automated command line program doing a lot of the filtering for you. 

## On the other hand, what risks could you foresee being involved in the process of creating too many custom maps?

I have talked about repetitiveness of custom maps, especially if it's that same custom mapper for one specific category. However, there are certain categories that are far riskier to custom map than others. In particular it's a lot easier to screw up in custom mapping for stream, jumpstream, chordjack or LN density than it is for other categories. For these categories, you run the risk of having the pick come off as looking like a low quality last minute effort that replicates someone else's mapping style, or just isn't impactful at all. I have always had the opinion that mapping well for these categories is the hardest task to perform. Mapping is the art of representing the music, and by consigning yourself to one category, you simply aren't given much to work with, and you have to have a lot of finesse with the patterning to let your style show. The canonical example is Shoegazer's DJ Sharpnel jumpstream series, which can easily be recognized from a mile away - it is extraordinarily hard to replicate her choices *well* in a way that makes sense with the music, although simply copying the patterns is far easier. From this example one can also see that song choice is extremely important: for instance, Shoegazer's jumpstream would have far less impact if it were mapped to katagiri, a music artist with far less interesting rhythms for jump placement. You can dissect Shoegazer maps further (which is something I highly recommend) but the point is custom mapping done well should be a difficult endeavor - after all, you're trying to create new and unique content for hungry players!

## Are there any important processes in pool editing/mapping that you think is often overlooked and should be exposed to aspiring pooling staffs?

I could talk about team competence/coherence: pooling teams with better communication and/or ability to judge difficulty and patterning will pool better. It goes without saying that pooling is not simply "picking maps for the tournament" (which is a common misconception for newer poolers): to fill out categories well, there's a lot of back and forth you will have to encounter when finding and/or debating picks, and players' expectations for enjoyability will be sky high. From this you can see that pooling becomes rather akin to solving a puzzle (something I discussed earlier and something I don't think a lot of newer poolers fully realize). But otherwise I think pooling is a pretty intuitive process! You'll develop your own style and hopefully you'll be good. If you aren't good you pool more. The skill ceiling for good pooling is very high, and I think it'll take many more years for all of us to figure out how to make pool "optimally".
