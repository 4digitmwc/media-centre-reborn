The current year is 2023. The osu!mania tournament scene is teeming with activity, with 4-key players duking it out in brutal physical mappools, with the most cutthroat accuracies they can muster in their best possible condition. Boredom in playing generic mappools have led to the deviation of player interest to **Slider Velocity (SV)** oriented and **Long Notes (LN)** oriented tournaments for the specialists, and other casual tournaments showcasing pools with slightly different appeals in song choices and gimmick plays. Region and country-based tournaments are also on the rise for players within the same areas to battle it out for spots in their MWC teams. Even the 7-key scene has returned in full glory, with flashy tournaments such as ETT being of noteworthy attention.

But do you really know how osu!mania was like *"back in the day"*? 

If you are interested in the Media Centre telling you about those *"back in the day"* stories, then this is the article for you! Allow us to take you on a time travel into the past 8 years, where various veterans and newer players alike tell you a narrative of tournament gameplay and pools that you may have never experienced firsthand. Buckle in for a crazy journey through time!

## 2014: Origins

This was the year osu!mania became a gamemode recognized and realized by the developer overlords. Obviously, this meant that the playerbase was still in its budding stage, and most knowledgeable or star players came from other engines, such as StepMania, BMS, O2Jam and more. This is also unsurprisingly reflected as a large proportion of imported maps in both the 4K and 7K mappools. In fact, a good number of these maps are so well-recognized that they have since been ranked or loved. Some of the more unbelieveable examples include both 4K and 7K Expert difficulties of [Imperishable Night 2006](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/92190#mania/259067), the infamous [Wafles](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4476759) guest difficulty featuring 180BPM quadstream on the ranked mapset [AiAe](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/174381#mania/421066) and with some obscure BMS and O2Jam converts on the 7K end. This was obviously also accompanied by a selection of maps that were first designed in the brand new osu!mania beatmap editor, which surprisingly also includes the [J-Core Mix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/164429#mania/400353) marathon map as a tiebreaker.

These pools may look rough in terms of how playable the maps were, relative to the recent high-accuracy paradigm where players are expected to dish out perfect plays with high MA/PA ratios. However, the introduction of core mappers and their VSRG communities into the osu!mania scene was integral to breaking the ground on what constitutes a decent mappool.

## 2015: Dichotomy

This was a year where 7KMWC unfortunately didn't exist. It was, however, the year where osu!mania 4K saw a huge rise in interest for competitive play and saw the size of its bracket expanding from 16 to 32 teams, with a maximum of 6 members per team, from its previous 4. Many veterans you may recognize from other areas of VSRG existed in this iteration.

In the initial stages of this pool, a large number of featured maps are easily recognizable at a glance - maps from mappers who were very prevalent in beatmap nomination back then, maps that were ranked and remain a classic till today. One may see ancient names such as [Spy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1217122), [Starry](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2166199), [LNP-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4402842), [victorica_db](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2046044) and immediately recall the old days of the ranked section. Mappers who existed in that era may suspect there was a tinge of favouritism exhibited in these pools, especially towards the mappers who had decent relationships with the mappoolers. Interestingly enough, the final 2 rounds seemed to feature maps from Stepmania charters more prevalently, including the likes of [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707), [hi19hi19](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1014473) and [Fullerene](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2531335). More noticably for newer players, there also seems to be a big difference in difficulty and philosophies between some maps in the pools, including the ranked [Hesperides](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/309328#mania/735806) against a relatively much speedier [John Tanaka's Theme](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/308935#mania/690803). Believe it or not, this pool also featured [the hardest difficulty of Blastix Riotz](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1011768#mania/2117613)! 

In the same year, members of the community also expressed the first hint of interest in organizing community tournaments, such as the [Mania International Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/349167) (MIT). In an era where osu!mania players reigned from rich VSRG backgrounds consisting of multiple keymodes, multi-keymode mappools seemed to also be a trend in the scene, and tested both the physicality and dexterity of the players while attempting to maintain a casual and fun aspect of competitive play. 

With all of this out of the way, you may be wondering where all the noodles came from. If you are one of those LN enthusiasts, fear not, for 2016 was where 4K LN made its breakthrough into the tournament meta. 

Spurred by the zeal to organize a tournament, an osu!mania tournament series was also brewing at the back of some great minds who participated in MIT...

## 2016: Scramble

This year, [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783) and [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707) became poolers for MWC. To boot, this was also the first year [SOFT](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/SOFT) was held. Deviating from the manual seeding done in MWC, the famous 4-Stage qualifier pool was introduced in SOFT as a method to conduct the seeding of participants, and already features the SV-Accuracy-LN-Hybrid combination as a method to seed players based on their overall VSRG aptitudes and attitudes.

This was also tournament player's first exposure to LNs as a proper subcategory in the tournament meta! Interestingly enough, most of the playerbase was still incredibly new to the concept of playing LNs, and many maps we'd see ourselves playing at the "intermediate level" used to be the boss charts back in these years. Some of the LN maps featured in these LN subpools were also the most infamous ones loved and known to date, such as [Southern Waters Assault](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/694903#mania/1022204), [Dark Flight Dreamer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/455426#mania/976201) and so on.

Surprisingly, this was also the year where SVs were formally introduced to MWC. Many signature SV maps such as [Electronic Sound Lab](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/299842#mania/673946) and [Foolish Hero](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/488126#mania/1040762) saw the light of day. The idea of SV being in MWC could easily be as contested and controversial as it is today, for the insurmountable amount of time spent practicing these maps relative to the rest of the pool, and for its biasness towards players with habits from practicing music. Nonetheless, the SV maps in this pool are also decently prevalent even in the play culture of today's playerbase.

Of course, this forced the definition of the tiebreaker map to be changed to decently represent all subsets of the pool. The result, is quite undeniably, the essence of tournaments, the tiebreaker as we know it - except, there was SV in them.

Amidst other chaotic changes such as FreeMod and NoMod subpool splits in the mappools, there was a huge overhaul as to how pools were being put together. The giveaway of pool slots to LN and SV entries seemed to imply that the rice subpool had to be much more concise relative to previous iterations, and that LNs and SVs (and by extension, the tiebreaker/hybrids) had to establish themselves more definitively by coming up with their own subcategories in coming years.

Which was exactly the point of 2017 4KMWC!

---

## 2017: Refining

This was the year [juankristal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656), [Pope Gadget](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288341) and [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092) made their debut as mappoolers for MWC.

For the LN players, this meant the introduction of a new LN playing style. The restrictive, control-oriented type that juankristal would then be known for mapping an abundance of them in tournaments, and the [first work](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663472#mania/1404354) of the infamous **Timing Hell** series, which is surprisingly a collaboration with [Ciel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1455309). This opened a multitude of possibilities for the LN meta, in terms of nature and difficulty. From the streamy kind to the jack-heavy, coordination-oriented types, you got them. Other aspiring and prevalent LN mappers such as [Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1388767) and [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783) were also often requested to design LN maps for various mappools in community tournaments. 

Almost simultaneously with the expansion of the LN meta, hybrids and tiebreakers first gained their reputation as the true test of all VSRG-encompassing skills in this year, with boss-esque charts such as [Scrap Syndrome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663256#mania/1403908) and [The Messenger 2012](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/664041#mania/1484095). These invoked the high demands of aptitude and attitude of top players by including physically challenging rice and LNs and difficult reading-oriented SVs as the icing on top, emulating the difficulty of the [MWC 2016 Finals tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/493316#mania/1055345). 

As this year came to an end, a couple of tournaments and competitions started to make use of the 4-Stage Qualifier format, and a similar branch-out from this in extension to bracket stages. The structure of pools in MWC and other tournaments could now easily be said to have been influenced by the works of SOFT. Therefore, it might be wise to take a further look into community tournaments to observe the evolution and concepts being proposed to be part of the meta.

Of course, categories were not set in stone despite the refining of the LN meta and structural changes to the pools. A lot of lingering thoughts about SV in hybrids and tiebreakers, and even opinions about SVs being in pools linger in the air. This is an enquiry that the year 2018 might give insight into.

## 2018: Soaring

Here is when MWC really started to skyrocket in popularity within the community. With the return of [Kamikaze](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2124783) and [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707) as poolers, this edition saw unforeseen competition between countries, along with the rise of some of the most popular players in the game such as [wonder5193](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8474029).

Fully integrating LNs as a essential part of mappools, this year’s MWC tested much more of each team’s LN prowess, while at the same time not completely nullifying other varieties of maps. The infamous **Timing Hell** series continued on with its yearly appearance in MWC with [Talent Shredder](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/853532#mania/1783836), while also having a few iconic maps such as [Bass Drop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/616168#mania/1780964), [Starfall](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/762671#mania/1778183) and [Shakunetsu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/853414#mania/1783636) in the pool. These maps were a big jump in difficulty from the past year, with the **finals tiebreaker** being truly a step above the rest of the mappool. SV maps were also taken more seriously than previous editions, with more players showing interest in SV, but still received criticism for their inclusion in the mappool, especially in the hybrids.

SOFT also launched with its [third iteration](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/SOFT/3), featuring maps that rivalled MWC in difficulty. Still continuing on with the tried and true 4-map qualifiers to seed players. The mappool of SOFT continued to have an influence on MWC as most poolers also had roles in MWC, resulting in many overlapping maps between the two tournaments. 

There was also a rise in aspiring community tournaments, be it national or international. Again, most of these tournaments followed the structure of MWC and SOFT, including the increased frequency of LN maps in these tournaments. With this, rice-only tournaments gradually began to fade out of the scene as hosts started to prefer a wider variety of maps in their pools. 

This structure of tournaments seemed to have reached a stable equilibrium. However, with the ever-changing playerbase, and to avoid tournaments becoming too monotone, organisers started to get bold with new ideas.

## 2019: New Normal

In 2019, the osu!mania community saw a number of notable tournaments take place, including the Mania Beginner's Showdown (MBS), a 5 digit rank restricted tournament. As a continuation to the [2v2 :thonking: Mania Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/TMT/2TMT) (2018) which was hot amongst the 4-digit (btw) players, the [4 Digits+ MWC](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/4DM/1) was organized as a tongue-in-cheek tournament for them! Additionally, the [:thonking: Newbie Mania Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/TNMT/1) (TNMT), a lower 4-digit rank-restricted event, also took place, connecting the international and mainland Chinese playerbases. This led to the huge involvement of many community players in pooling, and provided them with an outlet to test out new pooling concepts as well as challenge themselves to make an easier version of internationally recognized pooling standards. This also introduced the additional dynamic of pooling with the playing capabilities of the rank region in mind, posing as a major challenge for poolers even till today.

Perhaps most importantly, 2019 was the introduction of new norms in the mappool selection of MWC - the largest and most prestigious osu!mania tournament, with the introduction of more technical and aggressive patterning. Despite this shift, the meta remained accuracy-biased in earlygame, with SV still present in Hybrids and Tiebreakers but at more sightreadable standards, accrued to the loss in interest of losing tiebreakers out of lack of practice (which happened both in SOFT3 and 7KMWC 2018).

Tournaments such as the [SOFT4](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/SOFT/4) and the [Speed of Light osu!mania Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/SOL/2019) are known for their challenging mappools, serving as a breakthrough in osu!mania mappool difficulty. Some maps introduced back then are still of relevant tournament lategame difficulty today. For example, [Falcom Sound Team jdk - The Azure Arbitrator (Gekido-) [Demiourgos]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/951869#mania/1987749) which also were used in [osu!mania World Cup 2020](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/MWC/2020_4k) Finals Round and still considered as one of the most stamina draining maps of all time.

One of the SV maps that defined 2019 is [Chroma - Lost Found Melody](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1051052#mania/2196635) by [Ciel](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1455309). Through over 900 lines of Python Code, they managed to create the masterpiece of velocity changes which were used in [osu!mania World Cup 2019](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/MWC/2019_4k). Through the repetitive patterns in the map with some variations from various sound samples in the song. This was the most enjoyable memorization SV map of all time. It was worth to mention that this map inspired some other memory-heavy SV maps like [phonon - polyriddim](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1182702#mania/2465806) too.

## 2020: Acquisition

In 2020, the Well-known Global Pandemic emerged. People tend to stay more at home. Hence the osu!mania community were more active due to being an online community. The mappools were getting spicier and there were some mindset changes and experimentation introduced in this year.

The pooling mindset had been changed to more explicit skillset design, for example, Rice had been subcategorized into various categories for example, **Technical, Mixed, Dumpstream** and vice versa. Hybrids were categorized into two subcategories between **Rice-Biased** Hybrid and **LN-Biased** Hybrid. SV started to cease the role in Hybrid and Tiebreakers. As well as the introduction of the first tournament where SV were not presented, [Speed of Light 2: Lucha Libre Edition](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/SOL/2020). They also introduced the **protect system** for the protection of some particular maps from being banned.

The tiebreakers were starting to get more significantly harder than FreeMods pool due to the mindset that it should be the more advanced judgement after both teams tied on the FreeMods pool. The star rating of some tiebreakers started to exceed 7*. The significant examples would be [Camellia - OOParts](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1344963#mania/2785547) by [Halogen-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/169992) from SOL2 which even some of the most skilled players at that period of time could not get an S, and [Camellia - Z:iRNiTRA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1368592#mania/2830093) by [HowToPlayLN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10879600) from [SEA Champions 2020](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/SEAC/2020), where the mapper decided to merge the various personalities into one map, resulted in the chaotic mess for the Grand Finale.

Talking about the mapping styles, the new mapping style were introduced in the mapping scene, which was called **Conceptualized Mapping**. The map with this particular mapping style are focused on the structure and strictly focused on consistency and the interpretation of the song. For example, Abraxos' [i/o - Possession](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1025679#mania/2145124) was mapped with this approach. This approach was used in various maps, for example [Feryquitous - Qavsell](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1187793#mania/2475325) by [Davvy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10047413) from [osu!mania LN Tournament 2](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/o%21mLN/2) which were used the technique called **Pitch Relevancy** to create the particular map. However, this approach were being criticized by players whether the concepts were appropriate for the mappool difficulty and did not created the unnecessary difficulty spikes in the pool.

Entering the world cup season, the mappools were not significantly harder than 2019, but there was the experimentation on overshooting the difficulty of the **Jacks** and **Jumpstreams** pattern. The introduction of [QUIL - GYMPIE GYMPE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/560952#mania/2435718) **1.15 rate**, which is 132 BPM jacks in Quarterfinals surprised a lot of participants in MWC. Another example would be [Le Dos-on - A](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/585451#mania/3875945) **1.15 Rate** with edits, a full-on 5 minutes of 235 bpm Handstream were introduced in Semifinals which got exactly 100% ban rate. However, this experiment indicated the new difficulty pinpoint for Rice beatmaps in the mappools as well.

The tournament with the format inspired from **Flash-Flash Revolution**, [Score Attack Showdown](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/SAS/1), was introduced. Where the matches were not conducted inside the multiplayer room, but in the google forms where players were required to submit scores to reach the summit of the leaderboard, and advance to the further rounds. The beatmaps in this tournament were all custom-made by various mappers. This tournament format inspired the way national teams conducted the **tryouts** and spark the inspirations of custom maps in the tournament further.

## 2021: Horizon

The year is now 2021, and the mania tournament scene exploded in activity as the number of tournaments held this year were astronomical compared to previous years, with more and more first-time tournaments being organised by numerous parties ranging all the way from casual players to experienced tournament staff. Along with this, there were also some gimmick-focused mania tournaments held this year, such as the [Flashlight 4K Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/FL4T/1) (FL4T) where players were required to play with the Flashlight mod, as well as [SV Summer Exhibition](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1313374?n=1) (SVSE) where the entire mappool is made of only SVs. Furthermore, the community saw the introduction of newer mappers and mappool selectors for such tournaments, example being the [4 Digit osu!mania World Cup 3](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/4DM/3) (4DM3).

[SOFT5](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/SOFT/5) also followed the idea of the removal of SVs in the mappool which prompted many other tournaments to follow suit in the upcoming future. While tournaments before this followed the 4-5 Stages format for qualifiers, [MWC2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/MWC/2021_4k) comes back with a bang with its first ever qualifier stage and also introducing a completely new qualifier structure. This is the 8-Stage format which focused on stratifying players/teams through both early game and mid-lategame abilities to provide a more accurate seeding result. With this came along not only a major increase in mappool difficulty but also pool meta changes for rice and technical maps, with maps and mappers from **Stepmania** and **Flash Flash Revolution** (FFR) playing a huge role. Overall, rice maps became more aggressive and complex, while LN gameplay remained unchanged.

**Jacks** were removed in the early stages of the game due to the lack of the existing resources and they were known to be the "accuracy battle", which did not address the purpose of the mappool: To introduce the variances within the scores. Therefore, Jacks started to be introduced in the middle game instead, starting from approximately **Quarterfinals** Round of the tournament.

**Jumpstreams** were being more balanced with the breakthrough from the well-known mapper, [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707), who managed to create jumpstream patterns which were a balance between density, difficulty and enjoyability, as well as the balance between two hands. Her maps were used a lot in the 2021 tournament meta, for example, [Kotori - Nanamori (youth Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1360301#mania/3186828) from SOFT5. Her jumpstream maps were popularly used in various tournaments, including major ones such as SOFT5 and MWC2021.

Tiebreakers saw the removal of SVs, and the existing Camellia Tiebreakers meta continued to be used. However, some known artists in the electronic composers community began to rise, with the style similar to those used in the previous Tiebreakers, for example, [ReeK](https://soundcloud.com/reek_wobs) or [Kyutatsuki](https://soundcloud.com/kyutatsuki). But then [Philippines Nationals Mania Tournament 2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1306124?n=1) (PHNM2021) introduced the first ever custom song in osu!mania tournament history: [NicDroid - Northern Lunar Node](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1524569#mania/3119317). Then MWC2021 introduced [SUPER MWC KART - Purple Palace](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1569527#mania/3205077) as the custom song for the Finals and Grand Finals Tiebreaker along with the fascinating storytelling video-game themed track, showing the community the huge potential change in tournament tiebreaker meta. Following this, some tournaments began experimenting with different types of tiebreaker maps and songs, example being The [Japanese Mania Championship 2021](https://twitter.com/JMC_4kosu) (JMC) which introduced a new tiebreaker stucture. As such, custom mapping became a more common practice, as well as custom songs for more capable and well-known tournaments. In the midst of all these tournament maps started to appear more frequently in the ranked section as well, by the help of mania Beatmap Nominators (BNs) like [Quenlla](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4725379) and [RandomeLoL](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7080063) who helped immensely in pushing a vast amount of these maps for ranked. In addition to this, mappoolers had also started to pick maps from ranked section to appear in tournaments.

## 2022: Ascension

Jump into the past year. 2022 was overall a fruitful and exciting year for the community, and for many reasons that could prove to be useful feedback to the tournament meta going forward.

By this year, custom songs had become a commodity in other gamemodes, and custom song tiebreakers had long replaced the need for many Camellia tiebreakers. However, we started off the year with the custom song from our community, and it is none other than in our own territory of 4DMWC. [Cryochemistry](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1698378#mania/3470230), the collab track of 2 artists who had experiences in VSRG, [BilliumMoto](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/38) and [Akiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/19587411). Though incredibly rushed in the production process, ended up as a great breakthrough in the creative processes for osu!mania, and is irreplaceable in the hearts of the participants with it being featured in the top-notch gameplay and performances brought forth by the grandfinalist teams. Several community tournaments followed suit with this, including [Fight Against The Past](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1828541#mania/3752841) from Chinese regional tournament [MCNC](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/MCNC/4K2022), as well as [Combro Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1645546?n=1) with [Break for Everest](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1910964#mania/3941727).

At this point, players had gotten so physical that the pools of 2 years ago had fallen out of relevancy, and accuracy battles still exist in the grandfinals pools for many tournaments. It was a moment of awakening for tournaments to finally step up their game in difficulty, which [SOFT6](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/SOFT/6) rose to, under the lead of classic poolers such as [Halogen-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/169992), [lemonguy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4693052), [guden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11626065) and [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811). With a revamped group stage structure and top-notch players challenging the poolers to push the difficulty of pools, the mappoolers outdid themselves time and again, introducing pools of incredible difficulty typically impossible to find in MWC. MWC this year, however, did feature its first Grand Finals pool, taking the difficulty scaling to greater heights. This was coupled with [Steganography](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1846639#mania/3793375) as the first 7* tiebreaker in MWC to also be ranked. 

Talking about MWC also ignites the conversation of the newly formed SV committee fully dedicated to developing a 100% custom SV pool. With [Orca-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7958845) and [Paturages](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1375479) leading the fray with other classic SV mappers and enthusiastic playtesters, pools featuring completely new SV charts, custom-tailored difficulty scaling and banger music choices appealled to the masses, which seems to make a statement against players who question the viability of SVs in MWC, continuing the debate on the same page.

And speaking of customs, what else can we also bring up other than the furious barrage of custom maps and songs brought to you by [o!mLN3](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Tournaments/o%21mLN/3)? Driven by a growing need for fresh LN charts and to bring a cutting edge to the LN meta, a large number of custom mappers new and experienced alike were introduced to the tournament. This was coupled with the switch in mappooling workflow to be conducted using Discord threads, which poolers from 4DMWC and MWC have both adapted for their upcoming editions. All of this, coupled with the enthusiasm of mappers, generated a total of 57 custom maps, with 3 of them being custom songs. Additionally, the largely extensive pools, with a hypercharged difficulty in the last 2, seemed to have provided larger tournaments with the waters tested for harder pools, and a possible change to future LN subpools.

Overall, the osu!mania community has seen significant changes and evolution in tournaments and gameplay over the past few years, with new mappers, mappool selectors, and custom songs continuing to shape the meta and drive innovation in the scene.

## Future?

In 2023, we have already started to see plans be formulated for the future. Plans for more custom maps (and by extension, mapping representation) have been duly noted by many tournaments including MWC, SOL3 and 4DM2023. Plans for really difficult tournament pool scaling that might put players' hands at risk have also been formulated. Ideas for custom songs are on the rise and many want in on the ride. Plans for other gimmick tournaments such as SVSE2 are also opening up new possibilities to explore the difficulty range and viability of a new meta. But before we delve into the meat and bone of this year's offerings, let us all remember that tournaments never used to be this way. Many veterans have laid the solid groundwork with tons of trial and error, and it is up to us to continue enhancing the meta everyday.
