**Breaking News**

Upon further investigation of The 5-Phase C.O.V.I.D Therapy Programme organized by Dr. Zouk has been now proven to be a hoax. 

The treatment process as highlighted by the surgeon indicates that people infected by C.O.V.I.D had to replace their cornea, with a week's of blindness in between removing the old one and inserting the new one. In the middle of this process, the patient had to return to Zouk's private clinic daily, and undergo hypnosis, where the patient would slip into a trance and peaceful state of mind, ensuring that they would be able to handle the colors that return back to their eyes a week later.

However, the surgeon has been caught releasing harmless gases in the therapy room, that patients claim to have smelled and fallen not simply into a trance, but also knocked unconscious. Following which, patients made reports of their organs failing, which upon investigation, the authorities discovered that an illegal organ trafficking ring was being run by Dr. Zouk, and was being powered by the organs of these patients, in which the organs in the victim's bodies were replaced with organs from various animals, including horses.

Dr. Zouk has now not simply been charged for the instigation of riots and public violence, but also for illegal organ trafficking and for his elaborate hoax.

The night before I was standing here, on the mountains and with the clouds, I had a dream.

In that particular dream, I spent a night on the exact mountain, sitting beside the girl. Except, she was alive, right in front of me. She wore the exact same blue robes the soul of essence did, but did not cover her face. Her gentle soft hair flew in the chilly wind, just as the transience of the moment. I looked into her eyes -- it was also transient and full of exhaustion, just as telling as the inversion and moment of death that she had to go through.

She looked at me intently, and drew the shape of the 4-star cluster I see in front of my eyes at this moment. 

"When these stars shine. That would be the time you chant the words of the past. Something that should be forgotten, but nonetheless, a timeless fragment of our past. It will once again, bring you through your memories, the ones you once forgot, but not anymore. Following which, the stars will start to shift and form a plexus in the sky. Then, I will be there with you in spirit, and we shall say our last words on this plane together. That will be when your wish is fully realized."

"To be capable of enduring the after-effects of inversion for this long is an incredible feat I have never seen from anyone on this plane. Surely, you're a person that has exhibited astounding resilience to have gone this far. I'm sure you will be able to pull this off."

"See you tomorrow!" She smiled and waved at me, like a good old friend I've never seen in decades.

There was something very moving about that smile, that I alluded to. Flashing back to the present, I smiled, just about the same way she did, and that gave me the resolve for me to chant those words that I so innately knew, but refused to say this whole time. It was indeed a beautiful fragment of our memories, one that has been forgotten time and again, but one that carried the emotion of the world. It has been so widely misused in the cyberspace as a means of spam, so it was time to place this quote back to its original place, where it truly stands, in the grand scheme of life and all other things.

## Essence

I was at the top of the mountains, with the stars shining above me like white dots in the pure black sky. Just as the figure in my dream had explained, I awaited the sign to start the chant.

As much as it sounds unreal, I saw a cluster of stars start shifting at a ridiculously fast speed from the corner of my eye. They seemed to converge and cross paths at a place where I could see them, at a place in the sky that was so desolate and empty. It was as if I was supposed to see them - perhaps it was because of the girl lying right beside me.

It was also then where the 13 stars started to form lines between one another, as if forming a constellation in the real sky instead of a visualization on the tablet app. I could not tell if it was real. 

Either way, I began blurting out the words, just as I memorized it, one by one:

*"The tiebreaker is undeniably the essence of all tournaments. It is the fruit of hard work, the culmination of a valiant effort to fight and the manifestation of absolute determination. It is the desperation that creates friendship, the flood of adrenaline that replenishes life and the myriad of emotions that make one feel ever so momentarily blissful, that they could relish in the very moment where everyone belongs in the game. I really love the tiebreaker."*

It was a very silly line to say, but somehow everything around me started to change. My head felt light and the sky infront of me started to flash and distort itself in an uncontrollable fashion. My eyes were then blinded by white, as the sky started to open up. 

And for the first time in a few months, I saw colors.

The shades of the sky turned blue. But not in the blue you would expect from a clear blue sky on a sunny day. It was glowing in a very deep blue, almost as if it was frost lining up on the glass. And around me, the soft, white snow that was melting on the ground started to levitate and rise into the sky in a reversed snowstorm. Those moments, I faintly remembered at the back of my head. 

Those were the events of the *Symperasma Boreatica*. A tragedy of our past. The consequences of climate change, and the result of twisted fate and divine ordeals. The reason why we had to leave Earth and come to Zion, and suffer from the effects of C.O.V.I.D., and everything else that came with it.

*"From our beginnings, we uprooted inhumanely. The consequences are ours to bear, war and death, tragedy and sorrow, what can we do but to reap the seeds we sow?"*

As the snow left my eyes and the ground started to dry up, my body and mind went numb, and I lost track of everything that happened. I went unconscious.

Waking up, I found myself in absolute darkness, with a faint point of light shining through at a despairingly large height above me. The light seemed to point towards some space in this dark plane, so I levitated towards it. There lay an endlessly deep well. With the power of curiosity pushing me and the lure of fear pulling me towards it, I mustered the courage to look into it. 

And when I looked into the well, I faintly saw a girl look up and stare into my soul from the bottom. And from them, a red and black fog started flying out from various exit points, and congregated into an ominous red energy ball. Suddenly, the ball was ejected at the speed of a particle charged by the Hadron collider, flying right through my eyes and into my body without any time to react.

As the red energy surged through me, I could feel another version of myself grow within. A murderous entity, one who had previously hurt the people I once loved. I knew instantly, that I had to internally quell this version of me, that haunted my past. Whether I would be alive at the end of this internal struggle was an uncertainty that I had to grapple with, but I did not have the time for it.

*"The universe is made of absolute uncertainty, but we seek absolute immortality. Until we realize that, all stars, immortal as they seem, are born and disintegrated over time. The only thing we can pray for, is that in this finite life, we live to our fullest capacities as our mortal bodies can handle."*

I looked into myself in the mirror that flashed right in front. Except, that wasn't actually my reflection; someone else - a monster - was looking into me. It reached somewhere into its pocket, drew out a knife, and pointed it towards me. Was this part of the mistakes I had committed before I died and lived on a borrowed wish, that I obtained from the same plane? 

Speaking of the mistakes, the memories of murder and mutiny started to flood my mind and tear it from the inside out. The pain that no one innocent should ever have to experience. I remembered the hideous crimes against humanity that I had committed in the past. This was also something I had experienced back in the inverted world, as far as these sins took me, after all. 

But I remembered the mistake I had made that time - I made the pact with the entity of the orb, to live without the essential part of myself.

*"It is only by realizing our mistakes that we progress. As we grow to overcome our foolish desires, we may find constant happiness in this ever-changing universe."*

Someone whispered those words into my ear. Hearing that, I knew what I had to do. *Reject those desires, and prevent them from ever reaching you. There would be no wish to be granted, or epidemic to remedy.*

Without hesitation, I grabbed the mirror with my two hands, and slammed the glass surface on the ground with a strong flick of the wrists. As the mirror broke, I once again fell into unconsciousness. 

Waking up once again, I was transported back into the mountains. This time, as I woke up, I saw a gleam of hope in the sky. The night space was illuminated in the beauty of an aurora. It blended the warm yet glorious shades of yellow with the deep blue of the sky, making the scenery as bright as day.

It was a scene that was truly beautiful. That, I did not see for long, however. For the girl I had saved suddenly faded into my sight, alive and more vivid than she was ever before.

She walked right up to me, and placed her hand on my head, just as in the dream.

*"Today, we shall celebrate the uncertainties which were overcome, the conflicts which were quelled and the sorrows which were lifted, and create the greatest star that will burst into the brightest supernovae and illuminate the universe."*

And as she said that, we started floating higher and higher into the night sky, along with the stardust that were floating right all around us. This gave a huge rush of euphoria and excitement that I had never experienced before in my lifetime. I waited in anticipation as she raised her other hand to do something even more magical.

And as she did, the stardust started glowing a serene shade of light blue, and swirled around an arbitrary point above her palm. They congregated in a powerful vortex seemingly held together by a strong gravitational power that came out of nowhere, and started to accumulate into a large blue orb.

"I've never felt this large and mixed a myriad of emotions in my lifetime. Surely it must be your doing that is moving the universe, but what exactly is this that you are creating to save Zion?"

***This, is the true essence.***

And that was as far as my memory could remember of the events that happened after, leading to the supernova. 

What I did record however, as the final memory of my life, were my dying moments.

Lying down on the cold hard rocks of the mountain, I took one last look at the night sky above me. It was raining in the blue stardust, and I could hear people exclaiming in joy and sighing in relief as they embraced the regained sight of color.

There was something so immensely beautiful about this night sky, and it was not simply because of the color I could see. It was about the color I could feel within me. For the past 7 minutes, I was not living in the shadows of my past and wallowing in self-misery for them, but forward into the light, for the sake of everyone.

Now that the essence was restored to everyone affected by the virus, a lullaby was putting me to sleep. As I looked up into the sky once more, I could see the 4 blue stars glow. It was a sight I would have wanted to see for an eternity, but the fatigue was hitting me.

*"Close your eyes,"* a voice beckoned. And as they did, I closed my eyes. 

It was a good night for everyone in Zion. 

And it was going to be a long one for me, too.
