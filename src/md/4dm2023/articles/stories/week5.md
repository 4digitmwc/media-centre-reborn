**Breaking News**

The culprit responsible for moving the unknown corpse into plain view for the public has been re-arrested. He claims to go by the name of "Dr. Zouk", a surgeon who works at a rundown hospital and specializes in kidney transplant operations. Strangely enough, he had been spotted by witnesses and CCTVs to be stalking the girl whom the body belonged to for about 3 months, waiting to take action the moment our spaceship landed in Zion. When interrogated as to why he moved the unknown body to instigate public conflicts, he claimed to do it with an intention of promoting his own business, which also claims to provision a cure for the Cognitohazadous Ocular Vision Imparing Disease, or C.O.V.I.D for short. The truth behind these words remain to be revealed.

The log of the **TIDUR** model was littered full of *independent*, *identical*, uniformly *distributed* binaries. It was a mess to read, but my eyes lay upon something unusual. They were lines that stood out, not as a string of zeroes and ones, but a text written by an unknown entity.

Different from the thousands of Eldritchian horror and religious literature that spent hours talking about vicious cycles of retribution and tragic fates, this text spread a message of hope. It held as a symbol of unwavering resolve, and told the story of a bright future ahead for Zion. Most of the text was unreadable due to low memory left on the computer, but the first few lines struck me with a wave of strange nostalgia and euphoria. 

*"The unidentified objects share life with all of Zion. They harbour the colors of day, the splendor of night and the vibrance of life. Just as humanity had secured themselves their final chance at continued survival in the vast unknown space, what lies within these objects will bring about the revival of the civilization, and the joy of the masses. However, it is not that everyone in this world can wield the power of this substance -- rather -- the Vessel has to exist in this plane, and in front of these sacred objects, speak the words which will let it be done. And so these events shall be done, in the name of Zion and the rest of humanity. ZQU82ISUvsU8..."*

The words read. As I ran through the strings, it occurred to me that this text predicted some astronomical event to happen, which required something from an unidentified object. Decrypting the texts, I found strange images of comets and stars glowing with a bright aura around them. What was strange about this, however, was the powdery-like substance falling like snow from the celestial bodies. It was obvious to me that this was exactly the reason why I could sometimes see colors in the deepest nights. These celestial bodies seemed to be emitting some substance that allowed me to regain the ability to see colors, even just for a brief moment.

Harbouring that thought seemed to make me experience the sharp edges of knives and bullets pierce through my mind. Whatever I was missing, was probably a result of what gave me the loss of memory, emotion and colors from what happened in the Inverted World. Visions of the past started to flash by my eyes, and my body gradually grew numb to the afflicted pain.

The next moment, I was in a world of darkness. I expected to be greeted by a hideous reflection of myself, just as the epic spoke about. Instead, white flashes lit up amongst the darkness. I was surrounded by the stars in the night sky. I was in the embrace of starlight, and so I saw the colours. The stars glowed of different shades and hues, and resembled the constellations just as the piece of the sky we could watch from Zion. 

Faintly, I saw a figure clad in dark blue robes approach me from a distance. Though their face was hidden within the depths of the robes, I could tell that they were bleeding, just from a few darker drops hanging from not only their chin, but also the robes. Approaching within a metre's distance from my lips, the figure held out their hand, and placed it gently on my head. They then proceeded to utter the following:

*"Do you seek the vessel your world needs? Fear not, child, for I am a spiritual plane away from delivering the chaos that has unleashed itself upon Zion."*

"And who may you be, if I may ask?"

*"I am a soul made of the essence of life. Many people who chose to give up their life in exchange for keeping their essence of life now exist and wander in this plane of limbo. In exchange for losing our lives, however, we live an afterlife nourished with color and vibrance, embellished by beautiful starlight. The pandemic that currently runs wild on the surface of Zion can be traced back to a loss of this vibrance - losing this essence of life means that you lose a sense of purpose and meaning, which is truly worse than death itself."*

"Then could I ask what the essence of life truly is? And if it is possible to return them to the eyes of C.O.V.I.D.-infected people?" 

*"An **overcomplexification** of **starlight**, or more simply put, the entanglement of them, creates the **essence** of life. Only an individual who has chosen to retain the *essence* is truly full of purpose, and can never have emotions or colors taken away from them, even for eternity. As such, the only people who can truly bring forth more *essence* to your world, are the people who live here. You would have to find a way to temporarily pass a soul here into their bodies in your plane of existence, to have them truly come alive and work their magic."*

They then left me with these final words: *"Look into the polychromatic, in the deep depths of space. There, you may find the answer you are currently looking for. Good luck."*

As my vision cut to black, I found myself lying on the cold, hard ground of the research lab. 

That looked like a dream, but it did not sound like one. Everything the soul had explained to me in the other plane, seemed to line up with all literature that explained the loss of color. 

It must have been the presence and the absence of *essence*. The spell to initiate the crucial event in the sky, the *overcomplexification* of the *starlight*. It was to be discovered and harnessed by an individual who chose to take their lives to retain their essence in their final moments.

As I tried to connect the dots, what was the possible meaning of *polychroma*? No matter how many time you were to read this, this name always felt unusual... What was the possible background of this name, and did she have this substance? Would she be able to cast this powerful spell which caused this incident?

I looked into the sky from the nearest window, linked in between the stars. *Among the constellations*, there was the one group of stars which shone brighter than the others. Those were the *nightburners* of this sky. Even if they were colorless to the residents of Zion, you could really feel something in these patterns. What was hidden beneath them? Was it the *essence* that humanity was seeking in order to regain the color of our lives?

As I gathered from the other plane, I was not the chosen one to cast the *essence*. There needed to be a method to awaken the chosen one from eternal slumber... but at what cost? It was certain that to resurrect a life, even for a short moment, it could take one's life away as a tradeoff. It was certain that to save the humanity, there needed to be a sacrifice, whether the body or the soul. It was certain that to reset everything, the *consequences* I encountered, the *forbidden act* I was not supposed to commit, I was willing to do it, to give all of my life for it. For a friend who encountered the same fate, for the humanity, and for myself.

The memories came back, one by one, like a sword edging closer to my heart, the pain growing as it drew closer to the fatal point. The memories I had gained from before the inversion, to the end of it. 

*Throughout the memories*, I had witnessed the *chaos*, the *dilemma*, the *abyss* and the *divine*. It was such an experience that one of those finite lives could have encountered. Standing where I was, I realized that it was the *indomitable spirit*, and the countless decisions I had committed that allowed me to stand here today.

With the memories regained, I knew that my life was going to be no more in a few moments. It was a mixed feeling that I wouldn't be able to see, to feel and to live as before the *consequences* overwhelmed me, but at the same time, it wasn't my desire to be here with this condition. There was also no proof on whether all of this would work out, but there was no chance for it to happen if we didn't give this a try. 

I made the one and only decision that would make sense, and that was, to return the *essence* to everyone. This was truly going to be my *last wish*.

It was a clear night. I ran down to the ETI Research Lab, and unlocked the chamber the corpse of *polychroma* was encased in. Moving the body onto a portable bed with wheels, I ran down the hallways, hoping no one would catch sight of me in the wee hours of the morning before dawn. I decided to take the body to the mountains, where the constellation I saw previously shone the brightest in the sky. It had to be done in extreme silence, and in secret. No one was going to forgive me from tampering with the body as it currently stands in the tension of the collective.

I looked through the stars once again. The one constellation with 13 points in the sky, with one particular cluster of 4 shining in an astonishing blue hue. These 4 stars resembled a melody. One that I had heard many, many times over to the point it has completely been engraved in my heart, and I knew why. It was part of the memories, and a memory that gave me nostalgia, solace, and relief, that the *fitting end to the chaos* came to pass, and the ordeal would soon be over.

I looked at that lifeless body. With the last hope I held in my heart, and the certainty that she would be the one who saved the world, and the right decision I had made to stand here.

I have no regrets.
