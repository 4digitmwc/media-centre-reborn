## Infinity

The year is 2023. Today, I sit here on my bed as warm as the heater underneath it, but with the cold of dead space engulfing any espirit within me. The multiple pipes inserted into my arms that inject chilly liquids up my spine remind me of the mortality that meets my eyes and threatens to keep them shut forever. Every moment I move my body to grab my phone invites otherworldly torture, and walking to the toilet feels like walking on the flames in the 9th circle of hell.

It is with every moment that I experienced pain like this, that I felt like I bore the punishment for desiring immortality, just as the inhabitants of this spacecraft. I was given none of the Arts; there was not enough for me, just as it was needed to necromance Logan back to life. It was also convenient for everyone else on-board to eject a crewmate who’s already pushing the border of life and death, by letting the inevitable consume them.

Death is, however, not an outcome I fear or hate. It’s simply something that comes with age anyway. As time slowly slips out of our hands, it is only human nature to want an unlimited supply of it. Despite all of that, it is also the scarcity of time that I value. It is the finite number of possibilities of accomplishments and achievements that make our lives worthwhile, after all. It is silly to desire immortality and infinity for anything; the unlimited number of opportunities available will drive our limited minds insane.

However, it is also reality that I am in space, traveling beyond Earth as we know it, with the destination far from reach. There’s no turning back now; the home we knew is now covered in layers of ice, made uninhabitable even for the hottest chick alive, thanks to the extraction of both the orca’s and cat’s Arts. Everyone on this ship is faced with a dire mission, to venture into the infinite unknown, and find the one exoplanet we can call home. 

Well, except for me. Following the rupture of my horse kidney (which is out of stock here), all I can really do is to accept the pain I experience as signs of my passing that is to come. I scoff at the idea of having a horse kidney failure, but it is what it is. 

For the last time, I bend my back to push myself out of bed, and pick up the tablet in front of me. With a little clink from the tablet, I am greeted with a series of typewritten Greek symbols, which I let free a smile on. I do not remember the name of the man, but he worked on this in earnest of extending the existence of humankind. As he dealt with infinity in the face of finite time, I was reminded of the tenacity of man, and how their works will ultimately progress and change the fate of mankind when faced with alien civilizations and humanly distrust.

It was with this tenacity that I took 2, 4, 6, 8, 10… 2n steps forward as ‘n’ approaches infinity, across the cold, empty hallway leading to Danny's workroom. It is only right that the Extra-Terrestrial Index (ETI) gets out to the ship’s captains. It may after all be the Holy Bible of the next 1000 years to come, in a final effort to salvage and protect mankind from potentially the malicious unknown. This is not unfathomable with the power of immortality after all.

WIth my trembling hands, I lay the tablet on Danny’s table, with a pre-written note. 

My job on this ship is done, here and now. Finally, my legs give way into the flames, and the color in my eyes fade as I braced for the impact with the cold floor.

As trails of red flashed by my already monochromatic vision, all I could think was: This was a finite life I well deserved and lived. 

I have no regrets.

I woke up in my room, in a spaceship. But the anomaly is I couldn't feel anything. I simply felt numb. I opened up my computer and found my leftover binary files which were historical records of humanity before the destruction began. 

As I read through the records, memories of freezing events and pure darkness flooded back into my mind. I discovered the afterlife... Surprisingly I was alive after the torrent of glass shards. The glass reflected the consequences of what I've done in the past - it was excruciating and insufferable. But I deserved it. 

What is left of the storm, is a deserted wasteland, without any remnant of light or color. I simply could not get myself to feel guilty over my past actions. I shall move on with my life without unnecessary emotion. Conveniently, the benefit of being emotionless is the ability to do anything and constantly achieve without reaching the brink of exhaustion. Yet, it all felt worthless being unable to feel anything from the accomplishments.

Once again, I sat down at my computer, opened and revised what was written in my favorite notebook and began to perform extended calculations. Within a glance, I began to notice anomalies in the records of humanity. The legends of so-called "Extraterrestrials" among us might be true after all... but how do we define them?

*As a person, you can detect Extraterrestrials at the very first glance. But for an emotionless machines like a computer, a notebook or even me myself, it is impossible to distinguish between a single human and an Extraterrestrial. The legends claim that "Extraterrestrials (ET) usually possess an anomaly that allows them to perform tasks better than what humans can imagine". There are so many different ways of defining the performance from the records, namely, the multi-dimensional numerical data with high censoring rate. I attempted to adjust the definition of "outperforming" by highlighting the records which have the high performance scores compared to others. Additionally, it was also important to identify such crewmates typically resided in. They apparently live in places where the population density was low, in seclusion, away from other living beings...*

Mashing hard against the keyboard for as long as I could remember, I managed to complete the task. Then I looked at the clock... 2000 years have passed. I began to write the interstellar communication protocol, documenting every detail as understood and analysed of the Extraterrestrials and safety measures to take when encountering them. Walking out of the room, I suddenly felt something... It was an unusual feeling I've never felt for millenia after the destruction, something that liberates and enables you to make the most irrational decisions in face of constraints. Inhaling the serenity of space with the laptop softly whirring in work in the background, I felt compelled to smile. It felt like a job well done for now.

With the revival of my emotions from the *encrypted* memories, unfortunately, I lost my capability to see the world in colors. As I smiled, I could feel layers of my vision disintegrating into the space. The navy blue laptop cover seemed to fade to black and white, and so did every flower, planet, or star in sight. 

It was so long since I started to inspect those binaries, the 0s and 1s. I started to observe the beauty in the nature of fuzzy logic, but that did not satisfy my emotions at all since I couldn't see the "true essence" of life, the color. Even if someone bled or teared up, I would not be able to tell if they got hurt, or got upset. I would not be able to see if a plant was alive based on its leaf color. I would not know how to feel, even if I had the ability to. 

The *consequences* are still haunting me.
