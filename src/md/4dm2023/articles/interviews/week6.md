## Singapore

**So first off, how are you guys doing?**

**TheOPMeme**: Same thing, the rest are quite fine, I am the only one in shambles. Though their spirits are likely down as well

**awdse22**: I'm doing alright, especially with less commitments (supposedly) in the upcoming week. However I'm a little concerned about my teammates or the team in general now as I know they may not be feeling the best after the previous match with china, hopefully things will get better.

**icxfire**: Honestly feeling pretty terrible right now. Looking at my performance in match it can really be improved on. Comparing it to my scores in practice they are in two different worlds, I suppose it might be because I had pushed myself too hard during practice and it translated to me basically mentally collapsing during the match.

**riunosk**: Similar case to me but I didn't really push myself that hard on practice, I just failed to perform when needed. only thing that frustrates me is that that was a very winnable game

**McButt**: Of course it was saddening. We not only lost a guaranteed 2nd place but also need to play up to 3 matches next round. As for my own performance I'd say I did fairly okay but definitely could've been better as i somehow managed to miss on a select few of the maps I was confident in but also fc'ed a couple I didn't have confidence for. i also had group project non stop for the past week but i cant rly blame that since it only actually affected my sv practise which i did okay on anyway

**So obviously, this was a match that came down to the wire as Singapore vs China went into Tiebreaker, only for China to narrowly escape with the win. What happened in the match against China?**

**TheOPMeme**: A couple of hours ago, I had a 5 hour long computing competition from 12pm to 5pm, coming home at 6pm in the meantime. Because I still need to eat dinner, I can only play at 7.15pm, 1 hour less of my warm up time with our match at 9pm. Furthermore, I also need to play sv maps for free points otherwise awdse complain. Lastly, because I have no time to play during this week (trust me, I got busy schedule), I never play map, TB as well. Therefore, due to me not being warmed yet, tired af and sight reading / not prepared / unable to switch playstyle during match, I was in shambles. Also map pool bad, only rc7 had triple jacks :murder: Anyways in general, I was tired and underperforming.

**riunosk**: My performance took a sudden dip even though I had just did one run of the map right before it was played, which was a significantly better run than what happened during the match.

**McButt**: Ah yes, I wasn't doing too bad for most of the maps because truth be told the maps I played didn't really need a very good session to get a good score on but I know a lot of the rice players were having a terrible session (running out of caffeine(?), having competition same day and generally underperforming ig) so generally big ouch

**icxfire**: We completely self destructed in our rice picks. We were ready to lose our ln picks to china due to their ln superiority, however we were not expecting to perform so badly in our rice. I had drank coffee before the match in order to try and push for better scores and it was sort of working ( 995k in rc1, which also explains why we protected it ). Unfortunately the caffeine ran out during the match and the sudden tiredness + stress and pressure of performing to standard ultimately led to my downfall during the match. During tiebreaker, the moment i saw myself missing in the first 30 seconds of the match i already gave up all hope, knowing that china will move on to guarantee themselves 2nd.

**So Singapore is moving down to the Loser's Grand Finals. I know this loss is frustrating but if there is a team that can overcome from that match, it's definitely Singapore. Will this loss motivate you guys more heading into Grand Finals week?**

**TheOPMeme**: Good news, no more external competitions next week for me

**awdse22**: For me I can't really say for sure since I'm generally just chilling throughout the tournament and I'm already prepared for anything to happen. I just hope things won't get worse especially with the commitments some of my teammates have.

**McButt**: I'll be motivated as i can be other than the fact i have the exact same group project continuing for the next week 💀 (9-6 pls help me)

**icxfire**: I think that this loss has basically shown us that we have a major weakness, which is our consistency. If you analyze our match between china and compare the scores ( in rice picks, their ln release is way too superior ), our accuracies are ridiculously similar to china's, showing 2 things. One is that if we didn't miss we probably could have taken the point. Secondly, if we manage to not miss, we do have the accuracy advantage in this scenario. In this following week I'm sure that most of us will be hard pushing skill in order to match the difficulty of the grand finals pool in order to not have a catastrophe of misses in the match, we will also be training every single skillset in order to not make any mistakes during the following matches. China may have protected the map we were supposed to ban, but i'm certain that if we manage to improve, we might be able to take that point.

**One more question: So 4DMWC still has the Loser's Potential Finals Match that needs to happen between Canada vs Brazil. Who do you guys think will win to face off against Singapore in the Loser's GFs?**

**riunosk**: I hope we go against Brazil, we may have a better chance. But I think Canada might win. Their rice is spooky.

**McButt**: I don't really know who would win exactly because Canada is goated on rice and Brazil is overall amazing at ln but hopefully Brazil wins so we have less timing hell and also maybe possibly we have a slightly better chance at winning?

**icxfire**: While both remaining teams are really strong, both has its weaknesses. For example, while Canada has a really strong rice foundation, their ln capacity seems to be slightly weaker and can be exploited. For Brazil, it seems to be the opposite, their rice is shown to be slightly weaker, however they do possess ln capabilities that can punish us if we aren't careful. While I myself am hoping for Brazil to win ( sorry canada i still believe in y'all), i feel that scheduling will still be a massive issue between either countries and us.

**awdse22**: Personally feel canada may win but it's really really uncertain

**TheOPMeme**: Canada. Axel wasn't warmed in his match, svp-, their ln player, wasn't there as well (On their match vs Canada in Winner's Semi-Finals) I think score would be 7-3

**icxfire**: Honestly depends. If Brazil wins on LN and hybrid, match might go to TB.

## Brazil

**So after the match, you guys were just 10k points short from defeating Canada from finishing in the top 3 again. How did that match go for everyone?**

**Maykee kee**: I played very well on the LNs.

**Buvuw**: I was really really nervous, considering i skillboosted yesterday. So i was like: "oh theres no way i will be doing great today." and guess what? i was playing kinda bad and I was inconsistent too.

**Soore**: As expected, it was a close match.

**Nayeonie bunny**: I think I could have played TB but it's hard to decide the team before a match so it happens.

**Zergh**: It was nerve wrecking, I had a slow start and kinda messed up some maps that I knew I could've done better but after HB2 I got so hyped and only got PB's. Props to teamCanada for having amazing scores at the rices, it was a good match.

**Jeyfor**: I'm happy with my performance against Canada, I didn't pb anything but definitely better compared to the last matches. Now the match itself was kinda of what i expected,we win most (or all) the ln picks and get some point on rice, especially rice 1 and 7, but that didn't go as expected... and we lose the break point 2 times lol. If we had won the rice 1 we would pick the last hb(probably).

**(To Zergh, maykee kee, and Buvuw) You guys played the tiebreaker and the score had flickered so many times. Did you guys believe you were going to win the TB against Canada, or did the breaks throughout the map made you lose confidence in your abilities to perform at your best?**

**Maykee kee**: Yea. Because Canadá was a little bad in LN, so I thought we could've won. But I was shaking so much.

**Buvuw**: I was believing in us because of the LN parts, but I noticed I was missing WAAY too much so I didn't gave up but I lost faith. It was close still.

**Zergh**: I was so hyped to play it, I had a 920k before the match but I knew I could've done better and with hype it happened.

**In terms of expectations, did you guys succeed in what this team wanted to accomplish for 4DMWC 2023?**

**Buvuw**: Hmmmm, idk. About myself, I achieved my goals.

**Jeyfor**: We wanted to win so I guess we didn't succeed.

**nayeonie bunny**: Exactly what Jeyfor said.

**Zergh**: No, as I said in the other interview our goal were at least top 3, but in terms of scores and improvements I have no doubt we did it and even surpass it. Ever since the first day 4DM23 was announced Yuragi and Demi (and later on Lothus and Marcinho) created a discord server with everyone interested in playing the tournament and gave everyone goals to achieve in all skillsets, we have been improving as group for these past few months and if it weren't for them this 4DM run would never gotten so far. Seeing how much we've improved makes me happy and i want to thank them for all the support and motivation they gave us this past weeks. ❤️ (Salve para todas as bixas)

**One more question: What do you guys think the future will hold for Brazil for future 4DMWC tournaments?**

**nayeonie bunny**: I don't intend to play again.

**Jeyfor**: Me too. Next 4dm will be a totally different lineup.

**Buvuw**: Yeah, I mean I'm not 4 digit anymore.

**Jeyfor**: I'm probably gonna get skillbanned next 4d so :skull:

**Zergh**: Only fortunes ahead. The Brazilian community is expanding so much and seeing all the players in our tryouts this year that weren't chosen makes me sure that our future is bright xD I'm sure they will be doing amazing next year since this will be my last one. I already feel sorry for whoever has to choose among all those players like I did these last editions, it's tough man.

## Canada

**First off, how are you guys doing?**

**svp-**: Pretty good coming off that stressful win over Brazil, just waiting for the mappool showcase now. Hyped for our first grand finals appearance.

**AmariaLove**: I may be pleased and feeling very happy right now, but the voices..... they are not pleased. THEY WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE WIN THIS TOURNAMENT.

**twitch chat**: I am doing good.

**Axelerrixx**: _-sighs-_ c'est un mal jour et jee pas m'apple maple axelerriques parce que les sunapple dire quee je sius alegserrigs

**Congratulations on making it to the grand finals! You guys almost swept against Malaysia, but went into a huge war against Brazil. How did the weekend go for Team Canada?**

**AmariaLove**: I think we had a very surprising match vs Malaysia. I believed them to be way stronger than what they have shown in our prep. So that was to me kind of a bummer. For what it is from brazil. I viewed it as the last chance to kick them out of the tournament. If there was one team to do it, it was us. No matter how easy people thought that the win over Canada from Brazil would have been, we proved them wrong. I'm pretty sure China and Singapore are very happy about that Canada Victory.

**svp-**: We felt alright going into malaysia but we all knew that brazil would be a very challenging matchup for us. We played Brazil in the previous 4dm in losers finals and we beat them in a very close match. This year felt like an opportunity for Brazil to do the same to us again in losers finals. Going into the match there was some added nerves and pressure built up from previous match history.

**Axelerrixx**: Honestly, I never really thought we would win against Brazil since literally all their players popped off in the previous match, I still think that we didn't deserve the win. Brazil had the potential to win 4DM5, I'm very sad that they didn't make it into Grand Finals with us. Malaysia was also a cracked team and I genuinely thought that they would blow through this tourney, I got very scared knowing that they seeded above us.

Also, I want to express my sincere thanks to the members of both teams, the matches were a ton of fun to play:

**Thanks to the members of team Brazil**: Zergh, maykee kee, nayeonie bunny, Jeyfor, Buvuw, and Soore

**Thanks to the members of team Malaysia**: -einar-, JayLye, Cryolien, tosai_, stygix, and ju1ny11

Lastly, I want to thank the moonbanana for establishing the *alegserrigs* name!

**twitch chat**: I was relieved when we won against Malaysia since it wasn't as close as I thought it would be, but I knew we had to be at our best vs the match against Brazil. My job is to do better than their 3rd player so I pretty much just pushed all week to be able to keep up.

**So for the first time ever, Canada will be finishing in Top 3 for the first time in 4DMWC history. How does it feel to be on the guarantee podium spot knowing that you guys got revenge last year, when you guys lost out the last podium spot?**

**Axelerrixx**: I GET TO FUND MY XBOX GAME PASS ONLY FOR ME TO CRASH CAR IN FORZA HORIZON 8. vroom.

**AmariaLove**: I think it feels good, as always i'm the player that's lacking skill in the team. Only there for SVs. I will keep doing my best to support my team into giving them SVs point and hope we win!

**Axelerrixx**: Ok Mr. SV1 MVP

**svp-**: Yea it's amazing to have made it so far. Going into this tournament my mindset was that if Canada is ever going to make the top 3, it's gonna be this year or never. For many of us, this may be the last year we choose to play 4DM and it feels great to actually make it to the podium. I can quit w in peace now.

**twitch chat**: It feels awesome to make it to grand finals. I've played lots of tournaments in std and mania and it is my first time making it this far.

**So you guys are going to have a rematch against Singapore in the Loser's Grand Finals, and potentially taking on China in the Winner's Grand Finals. Aside from time zone differences, will you guys be able to perform at 100% against the Asian teams?**

**Axelerrixx**: I will give an honest answer this time: nope, we won't.

**twitch chat**: Yes we are gonna pop off!

**svp-**: "its now or never" - Amaria to our rice players at match point

**AmariaLove**: I have nothing else to say, except timezone is not good for us (history will write itself)

**Is Canada proud of your guys performance in 4DMWC this year if they kept up with the news?**

**AmariaLove**: Only Ice Tiger came to cheer us on. Thank you Icetiger333 We love you. For the others, they will show up as much as we play jackbox together

**Axelerrixx**: Yes, especially the Walmart man and the 98 fc guy. Also, hello\_son is et, not me…

**twitch chat**: i think they would be happy

**One more question: Since the Hawaiian pizza was invented in Canada, do you guys prefer pineapple on pizza?**

**svp-**: I don't prefer it but it does not bother me. Pizza is pizza. I've never had a bad pizza tbh.

**Axelerrixx**: PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA IS SO BASED IDC WHAT OTHERS THINK. CANCEL ME IF YOU WANT, YOU CANT STOP ME!!!!

**AmariaLove**: Since when is Jesus coding these npcs that poorly that they think pineapple on pizza is good?

**twitch chat**: Absolute not. But it isn't as bad as people say it is. I don't mind pineapple on pizza but i definitely wouldn't order it myself.

**Regardless, thanks guys for the interview and best of luck in grand finals!**

**Axelerrixx**: Thank you. That means a lot to us.

**svp-**: Thank you Pork. We will win for you.

## China (English Version)

**Congratulations on your victory against Singapore! This was a very tough battle that saw you guys go 6-3 against Singapore before Singapore got a 3-point comeback to force the tiebreaker, only for China to win the tiebreaker against Singapore! What was China's strategy coming into this match?**

**[GB]Mafufu**: I've already said the strategy was Mafufu's TIMING HELL lol. The tactics were all planned by Luoxuan, he is our tactician! Alright, I do believe in our LN skill, so trying to win all the LN and HB maps was our strategy, although we lost a LN and a HB and they lost 2 RCs. TB wasn't in our plan, cuz we haven't thought about winning the TB map, but the desire to win made us perform beyond our ordinary. For SV maps both of them are fun to play! But how can we win the duel with Singapore lol?

**lovely\_hyahya**： …φ(๑˃∀˂๑)♪ As a support occupation, I wanted to carry out a fun Timinghell & SVhell chart to protect Singapore's hands of warm, which we did (although our SUPPORT HEALER LUOSHUAN didn't hold on to the red polar cows' big impact). Unfortunately, through the CN broadcast stream or the official live stream, our warmhand was missing half of the time (sad). For SV, we know that Singapore is an invincible myth, but we also have to come up with a serious attitude, it's just a pity that zyu played sv1 when there is a personal skillissue so replaced me, so I played almost 100pc in sv1, FU\*K you AlexDunk !!! At first, we are playing well, Singapore's rc break gave us big confidence, but I made a very serious stupid mistake later - after playing sv1 I did not remember to change back to the original speed, resulting 3maps I played (hb3, rc7, tb) all played fast with explosion accuracy, and I still TB play half of the time to think about this matter, fortunately, my teammates are very strong, otherwise I just go Genshin Impact ;w;

**[GB]Luoxuan0327**: TBH our only choice is to select all the LN and HB maps and try to win TB, this is our real strategy. Singapore is really a scary team with almost no weaknesses, although they made too many mistakes in Jumpstream and Speed map, I don't think we will win these maps again if they do their best. Of course, we also have big mistakes in LN2 and HB3 (if we finally lose the match I'd be the burden hahah). The theoretical score doesn't mean victory, and actually, we performed very close, I think this is the real CHARM of this PINNACLE match. Besides, damn why my teammates sandbagged me lol, many of their scores in the match were much higher than their practicing scores, in that situation I became the supporter, not carrier as I thought before the match (wry. After this match, I kept my 100% WIN RATE in Tiebreaker and the TB result was 3 personal best in our team actually. Thank my teammates, Team Singapore, and all staff in 4DM, we together performed such a wonderful match.

**[GB]mmttyy233**：We almost have no strategy in this match. We lost with a big score in RC maps but just won LN by fluke, so what we only have to do is to win LN maps. With my teammates' wonderful performance, we eventually won by luck. Besides, I'm sorry that I performed well below the practice score xD. Finally, I would like to thank my dear teammates, strong opponents, and the organizers for their support.

**Molli**: I sent many owo to Team Singapore before playing sv, which was the strategy I mentioned in the last interview, and this might be the key to our victory! (just kidding xD) Actually, we have no confidence before the match. Except for the LN and some HB maps, other maps rely on our tenacious struggle to get a few points, otherwise, it's hard to say whether we could enter tb in the end and win. I was really nervous seeing their wonderful performance in SV maps and felt regret that I didn't practice harder and perform better. But I couldn't express it or they might have interfered. All in all our opponents performed well and we also didn't let anyone down. And thanks to the work of the host and staffs, we together performed the wonderful match.

**Zyuuu**: I thought Singapore only performed 60% of their skill in Finals. I haven't expected we could get break points in RC1 and RC2. The best choice was to choose all LN and HB then enter TB. Although we once went 6-3, we had many mistakes. The sv king, awdse22, made Singapore can't be defeated in SV maps. All in all, it's an unbelievable victory, and Singapore's performance deserves respect from all of us.

**China will be finishing in the Top 2 for the first time in 4DMWC history. I saw the bilibili stream and a lot of the people are very happy for you guys on your victory. What does this victory mean to you & China?**

**[GB]Luoxuan0327**: This means we can earn at least double the prizes lol. And we now have the precious bracket reset chance, which might give us an easier mentality facing the winner of the loser's bracket.

**lovely\_hyahya**： (っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾ Open the champagne! Thank you Genshin for giving me the power! For personal, I'd like to change my laptop which is worth 200$ in total (1400RMB), before the match started my computer shutdown in Singapore's warmhand because it couldn't hold down the super 105°C temperature causing it to overheat and shutdown, the emotional↑ damage↑ caused to me was still moving, luckily I blew my CPU hard with my mouth thus bringing down the temperature, thanks HP elite 8470p brings me confidence!

**[GB]Mafufu**: I want badge I want badge I want badge......(from a player who is experienced in tournaments but never won the champion) we will make history in Chinese 4K showbiz! And we will make a great achievement!! GREAT ACHIEVEMENT!!!

**[GB]mmttyy233**：Means one more week of ordeal and double prize.

**Molli**: For me, it means I'm closer to my FIRST PROFILE BADGE.

**Zyuuu**: Thank y'all to those who have supported us from the beginning to the end.

**Going into the Grand Finals, you guys will have the bracket reset in your favor. Last year, there was a bracket reset in 4DMWC. Do you guys think China won't be needing the bracket reset or do you think you'll strategize your match around the bracket reset?**

**lovely\_hyahya**： （￣～￣）Still not good, as the most realistic four-digits player, the final pool has been a lot of pressure on us, forcing us on the limits rather than accuracy above, it is difficult to imagine what the Gfinals pool will bring us different surprises/scares, we can only hope that the Gfinals pool is not too difficult, please 🙏🏻

**[GB]Luoxuan0327**: Absolutely I hope we can win directly without a reset, but tbh it's really just a dream. We all suffered from a critical skill-ban, but honestly, none of us can perform high scores if the difficulty of mappool rises too high (Even super carry Mafufu can't carry us in that situation). If so, we definitely can't perform well. Hope the map pool selectors can cut us some slack, and I will REAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY appreciate it `(\*\>﹏\<\*)′ (but in fact the difficulty of mappool was still beyond my imagination :w

**[GB]Mafufu**: For me, the schedule of GF will directly influence whether I could participate, and I hope the opponents could sympathize with me. And the mappool is now really unfriendly to me. It will be best if we can just directly win, but we should have to consider a special strategy if we have to reset the bracket. Just guess our real strategy?

**[GB]mmttyy233**：As a real 4 Digit skill player, I have nothing to do but to believe in my teammates. Bracket reset? I can't give my opinions.

**Molli**: It will be best if we don't need the reset, but we will still try to face any difficulties.

**Zyuuu**: The mappool may be extremely hard, and I just hope we could catch any chance of victory. I've performed unremarkable from the beginning to now, and have always been carried by my teammates, so I will prove myself in the last round!

**Thank you guys for taking the time to answer my questions. Best of luck to you guys next week!**

**lovely\_hyahya**：(\*´╰╯`๓)♬ Listen to me thank thank you, because you here, warmed the seasons, thank thank you, thank you here, the world is more beautiful, I want to thank thank you, because you here, love always deep in heart, thank thank you, thank you here, passing the happiness

**[GB]Luoxuan0327**: Actually I don't know what to say xD, just thanks for interviewing us :3

**[Genshin Impact]mmttyy233**：Thanks for interviewing us. I'm going to play genshit impart all the time next week.

**[GB]Mafufu**: (I will finish it after schoolwork) ←AND HE FORGOT.

**Molli**: Thank you guys for taking this time to ask my questions. Best of luck to you guys next week! (i am a repeater)

**Zyuuu**: good luck!

## China (Chinese Version)

**祝贺你们对新加坡的胜利！这是一场非常艰难的战斗，你们以 6 比 3 的比分领先了新加坡，然后新加坡追回了 3 分，迫使你们打平。这是一场非常艰难的战斗，迫使中国队进入了 TB ，只是中国队赢得了对新加坡队的 TB! 中国队在这场比赛中的策略是什么？**

**[GB]Mafufu**：都说了是Mafufu的Timinghell了！（笑）战术啥的都是给Luoxuan承包了的，战术师Luoxuan！好吧，我非常相信我们的LN，所以抢下所有LN和HB就是我们的选图策略，虽然双方都各自送掉了两张RC，一张LN和一张HB。TB不是我们的策略之一，我们并没有想过能在TB中获胜，不过想赢的心让我使出了超常的水准。对于SV，两张SV都很好玩！但是面对的是新加坡，怎么赢得了呢！（笑）

**lovely\_hyahya**: …φ(๑˃∀˂๑)♪ 作为辅助位，我想在一开始就进行有趣的Timinghell&SVhell热手图来保护新加坡的手感，事实证明我们做到了（虽然我们的奶妈落轩没有顶住红色极地奶牛大冲击），可惜不管是CN转播流还是官方直播流，我们的热手在直播的时候都缺了一半（残念）。 在SV方面，我们深知新加坡队是不可战胜的神话，但是我们也要拿出我们认真的态度，只可惜zyu打sv1的时候有个人差所以临时换上我了，为此我还特地打了快100pc的sv1，AlexDunk速来挨打！！前面几张图我们都是正常发挥，几张rc破发的时候给了我们大的信心，但是我自己在后期犯了一个非常严重的低级错误——在打完sv1之后我没有想起来需要改回去原来的速度，导致我后面打的三张图（hb3，rc7，tb）准度直接爆炸全部打快了，而且我还是TB打完一半的时候才想起来这件事，还好我的队友们很给力，否则的话我就只能能提前去玩原神了;w;

**[GB]Luoxuan0327**: 老实说，在纸面实力上，我们有且仅有保住所有LN和HB选图拼进TB这一个选择，这就是我们的真实策略。新加坡是一只几乎没有弱点的恐怖队伍，尽管他们在切和乱上有所失误，但我不认为他们的真实实力无法拿下。当然我们也分别在LN2和HB3出现了重大失误（如果输了，我将成为头号战犯）。理论出分不代表一切，正式比赛有来有回，我认为这才是这场巅峰对决的魅力所在。此外，我的队友tmd演我（笑），他们很多人在赛场上打出的成绩远高于练图时的出分，我从本应该的carry位变成了蹭局势的三号位（笑）。经此一役，我保住了在正式比赛中TB的百分百胜率，并且我们在TB中打出了三个个人最佳出分。谢谢我的队友，谢谢如此强劲的对手，谢谢主办方的辛勤工作，我们共同演绎了如此精彩的一场比赛。

**[GB]mmttyy233**：这场比赛中我们的策略就是几乎没有策略，我们在rc实力上全面被新加坡碾压，在ln上也只能勉强抗衡，所以我们能做的只有保下ln，在我的队友们的实力carry下，凭借运气勉强拿下了胜利。此外，我很抱歉演了队友，比赛打出的成绩远低于练图时的成绩（）。最后就是感谢我亲爱的队友，强劲的对手，以及主办方的支持。

**Molli**:我在打sv之前对新加坡的队员们说了很多"owo"，这是我在开打之前的采访中提到过的战术，这或许就是我们致胜的关键！（No）其实这场比赛大家心里都没有底气，除了LN和部分HB图，其他的图都是靠着大家顽强的拼搏才能拿到艰难的几分，不然最后能不能进入tb都不好说，在看到对面的sv发挥得如此出色时，我的内心是非常紧张的，我很后悔我为什么不能打得更高一点，但是我没有补救的机会了，我不能表现出半分懊悔来干扰队友的发挥，一直为大家加油打气。总的来说，对面的发挥是非常出色的，我的队友也没有让大家失望，也感谢主办以及staff们有条不紊的工作，为观众们呈现了这场精彩的比赛。

**Zyuuu**: 我认为新加坡在决赛轮只发挥了6成功力，rc1和rc2的破发我是没想到的。从策略上讲最优的选择就一米一面保发打tb，前期取得的比分领先的同时，我们也有失误丢分，sv有adwse22更是不可战胜，总之这是一场不可思议的胜利，新加坡的表现值得我们所有人致敬。

**中国将在 4DMWC 历史上首次进入前 2 名。我观看了 bilibili 直播流，很多人都为你们的胜利感到非常高兴。这次胜利对你们和中国意味着什么？**

**[GB]Luoxuan0327**: 意味着我们得到的奖金翻倍（笑）。以及我们获得了珍贵的复活甲，这将令我们拥有更大的底气面对一切对手。

**lovely\_hyahya**：(っ•̀ω•́)っ✎⁾⁾ 开香槟咯！感谢原神给我带来的力量！在个人角度，我想把我总价值1k4人民币的笔记本换一换，在比赛开始之前我的电脑还因为压不住super 105°C的温度导致过热关机错过了新加坡的热手环节，对我造成的emotional↑ damage↑还是很大的，还好我用嘴使劲吹了吹我的CPU从而把温度降下来了，感谢惠普elite 8470p给我带来的自信！

**[GB]Mafufu**：我要牌子我要牌子我要牌子我要牌子我要牌子……（来自一位久经沙场却从未获胜的玩家发言）我们要谱写中国4K界的历史！一写就写个大的！！超级大的！！！

**[GB]mmttyy233**：这意味着还要再折磨一周以及翻倍的奖金。

**Molli**:对我来说意味着向拿到个人主页第一个badge更近了一步。

**Zyuuu**：感谢从开始以来对我们支持加油的所有人。

**进入总决赛后，你们将获得对你们有利的支架重置（即复活甲）。去年，在 4DMWC 中，有一个支架重置。你们认为中国队是否需要支架重置，还是说你们会支架重置制定比赛策略？**

**lovely\_hyahya**：（￣～￣）还是不好说，作为最真实的四位数选手，半决赛图池对我们已经有很大的压力了，迫使我们把注意力放在极限而不是准确率上面，在此基础上，很难想象总决赛的图池会给我们带来什么不一样的惊喜/惊吓，只能希望总决赛图池不要太难，拜托了🙏🏻

**[GB]Luoxuan0327**: 我当然希望我们能直接赢下，无需重置，但实话说我认为很难。我们逃过了严厉的skill ban，但我们也确实不存在任何一位能在高难度图池下继续保持高分的选手（哪怕是下届必定会被送上ban位的带队大哥Mafufu也做不到）。图池难度继续提高的情况下，我们的大后期战斗能力必定难以招架，希望图池管理高抬贵手呜呜呜我在这儿给您磕头拉（结果图池出来一看还是超乎想象

**[GB]Mafufu**：对于我而言，总决赛的时间安排会直接影响我是否能上场的问题，我希望对手们可以稍微体谅一下我TwT。以及图池已经变得很不友好了（只是因为他打不好了，不要理他），能一举赢下比赛当然是最好的选择，当然如果不得不进入Bracket Reset，我们应该也会考虑Reset特殊战略。猜猜我们的真实策略？

**[GB]mmttyy233**：作为真实的四位数水平选手，总决赛已经和我一点关系没有了，我唯一可以做的就是相信我的队友。复活甲？我不好评价

**Molli**: 最好是不需要吧，但是还是会做好应对一切的准备就是了。

**Zyuuu**：图池可能很难，我只希望能在最后一轮的比赛中把握住所有能得分的机会，从第一轮到现在我的表现一直平平无奇，总是被队友抬着走，只能说争口气吧！

**谢谢你们花这个时间来回答我的问题。祝你们下周好运****!**

**lovely\_hyahya**：(\*´╰╯`๓)♬听我说谢谢你，因为有你，温暖了四季，谢谢你，感谢有你，世界更美丽，我要谢谢你，因为有你，爱常在心底，谢谢你，感谢有你，把幸福传递

**[GB]Luoxuan0327**: 不知道说啥，没活儿了，那就咬个打火机感谢采访吧
