## USA

**I'm here with Team USA from 4DMWC 2023 (5)! How are you guys doing?**

**Seth**: I‚Äôm doing good.

**Znowed**: Fantastic!

**Retina**: Doing great TBH.

**-Sky-**: I'm doing great, just a bit tired at the thought of having school tomorrow.

**So congratulations on your match against Thailand! This was a very interesting match given there are a lot of close battles on rice and hybrids. What are you guys thoughts on the match and how did your guys strategy change throughout the match?**

**Seth**: Going into the match I knew it would be close. Our first strategy was to protect SV and band rice considering Thailand's past matches, and luckily it worked out. After the first 3 picks we knew by then it would take us to TB or a win.

**Retina**: The match was kinda crazy, but we all had one goal in mind, and it was to win it and move on to the next match. But overall, fun all around. and to be honest, I‚Äôd have to say thanks to Seth for the strategies as he was the staple for the match keepin all together with the decisions.

**Znowed**: Honestly i loved every second of it from our first pick up till the very last one. I think we did well in terms of putting our practice into play as strategy kinda comes all over the place.

**(For Retina & Seth) So, you were apart of 4DMWC last year where the United States got the #1 seed. Obviously, some interesting roster changes with you 2 returning, and Scep coming back from 4DMWC 2021. What do you see for the United States for this tournament? Any expectations in mind as the 9th seed team?**

**Seth**: With all the roster changes from last year (and the pervious year) I was honestly a little worried;; It's really hard to tell how your team will perform even with in depth qualifiers. There's a certain amount of trust you have to build through in team qualifiers and RO32 that you don't have yet. All I really want to see is a return of the USA to the podium. I feel if we could pull it off then it would signify a sort of "return" of the USA  after the MWC podium finish. As 9th seed I find it really funny that we ended up in the same position as Brazil last year also being 9th seed. Seeing what that team did last year gives me hope that we could go far :>

**Retina**: All I can see really is this team being an incredible wildcard. Shout out seth for being able to pick our incredible team mates, everyone in our team is cracked and always help out one another during the match helping us claim wins. my expectations really is just to progress and attempt to bring it home for USA this year, since this mayyyy most likely be my final year playing 4DMWC as a whole.

**To everyone else, how has 4DM been treating you guys in terms of the amount of time you guys have been putting in?**

**Znowed**: 4DM has been really great, it's a lot of trying to manage my time as I go to school and don't have all the time to play, it can also be a struggle with wanting to push like this weekend where I injured myself. I feel that I'm very lucky to be in the team that I am in

**Retina**: He (Znowed) had to do finger stretches :sob:

**-Sky-**: It really hasn't changed how much I've been playing, I still try to play the same two hour time I give myself to this game everyday, and occasionally hold significantly longer sessions if I feel myself decaying in any skill set.

**So you guys are going to face the #1 seed Singapore in the QFs. Obviously, it's going to be a tough battle for you guys. And the QFs week also happened to be the same week last year, where the US lost in the Winner's QFs, and then losing the First Loser's SF match the week after. How are you guys getting ready for this match?**

**Seth**: Yeah, Singapore has some realllly crazy players, so studying a their past matches and getting their weaknesses is gonna be a big part of our prep. Looking back seeing were we lost last year is giving a big drive to bring it home here. And personally those losses have been weighing on my mind for a while now and I want to put them to rest. As this will probably be my last 4dm I want to make it count. :kauitsu:

**Znow**: Well we plan to focus really hard on our weaknesses and to better our stronger points as a whole. Accuracy training is something that I have been taking to the extreme as I want to do the most I can for the team. I'm sure with all our practice we'll make it through.

**Retina**: Just making sure I warm myself up physically and mentally for the upcoming matches. Gotta also make sure I play well enough and study the maps a bit before actually playing for my matches. This strat has always been my go to for all tournaments and still remains with me to this day.

**Scep**: All of us understand what our strengths are and other skillsets that we can work on, this year I've been dipping into uncharted territory which are SV's. Something I'd never really touched since my one play through during a match vs the PH in 2021. It does tend to be a bit mentally fatiguing but I've been managing. Warming up is also a very big essential (no brainer, ha).

**-Sky-**: I've been trying to work on my finger coordination and reading to hopefully help increase my accuracy. Also working on my physicality so I can hopefully help out my team in rice.

## Chile (Itourith)

**I am here with itourith from Team Chile! itourith, how are you doing?**

**Itourith**: I‚Äôm good. A little excited and shaky.

**So first off, congratulations on your victory! Can I get your thoughts on your victory against Finland?**

**Itourith**: Personally, I was very nervous since it‚Äôs my first tournament. And somehow I managed to play good. I thought I was going to do very bad. Happy that almost everything went fine.

**So, there was a situation that happened with hybrid 2 regarding xaxreid, can you explain what happened to him and his connection with ln2 & hb2?**

**Itourith**: I really don‚Äôt know and neither does xaxreid. He couldn‚Äôt load the map and the game crashed. And on my side my messages were not reaching the people in the lobby. And I think the same happened to Albania. Overall, it was a weird lobby.

**So this is the first time Chile will be advancing to the Quarterfinals since 4DMWC 2020 (2), how does it feel knowing that you are putting Chile back on the map by making it this far since 3 years ago?**

**Itourith**: I don't know how to feel. I didn't know that. I know that in Chile there aren't much players that are interested on tournaments, so I hope that our team change that somehow.

**And you guys will be facing against the United Kingdom, so what can we expect from Chile as 4DM is heading into the QFs week?**

**Itourith**: I don't know what to expect from the UK. That will be a tough match for us but we are going to give our best. I think I could say that will be a surprise regarding LN maps from me :eyes:

**Alrighty. Regardless, best of luck to Chile facing off against the UK!**

**Itourith**: TYSM!

## Canada

**So I am here with Team Canada, how are you guys doing?**

**Axelerrixx**: bongur jee m'apple (üçé) axeleriques

**AmariaLove**: We are doing great, it's snowing way too much where I‚Äôm in right now.

**Robert6400**: Too busy freezing to death.

**So first off, congratulations of winning against France! Can I get your thoughts on how the match have went?**

**AmariaLove**: I think it went as expected. I think we are not really happy about our LN ability right now. We are working on it. 

**Twitch chat**: I thought the match went well although I was hitting early because of nerves.

**Robert6400**: Well I was very nervous because it was my first tournament match so I thought I was getting a heart attack in the middle of playing rice 5 but I ended up pbing.

**[LS]Byte**: The match went well but there was a few unfortunate chokes other than that i think we can all agree it went well.

**(For Byte, Amarialove, svp_, & twitch chat) So obviously, you guys are back to 4dm after finishing 4th last year, just coming up short to Thailand to finish in Top 3. Especially since a good chunk of you guys have returned, as well as for newcomers Robert6400 & Axelerrixx, what can 4DM expect from this team? And what are your goals for this tournament?**

**AmariaLove**: Last year we had a 5 man roster and we managed to finish 4th. This year we patched the holes with very good players that cover our weaknesses well. Our goal is first place. Nothing less, Nothing more.

**Twitch chat**: I really want to win this year and I think we have a really good chance at doing so with how much we improved since last year. Robert and Axelerrixx are also insane at the game and with them I think we will scale much better into the late game than last year.

**Svp-**: The main difference in roster for this year is Robert. Axel coming in was essentially a more versatile equivalent replacement for acolyde who got screened out. Robert as a new addition is very strong at rice acc and basically extends our depth in terms of rice. Playing to this strength, you can expect to see more of a focus on the rice side of things from our team. Last year, having seeded 8th and placed 4th, our goal is to make it to the podium having seeded 4th.

**Byte**: Nothing to add on. (They said everything they needed to be said)

**So you guys will be taking on Hong Kong for the Winner's Quarterfinals. What can we expect from Hong Kong since that team is pretty talented with LN/HB/SV, comparing with the Rice abilities you guys have?**

**Byte**: If we work on the LN we might have a chance at doing well.

**I know Misoloto is going to be that player to watch out for, that's for sure.**

**AmariaLove**: I think their rice ability should be what other teams should look out from them. I'm not scared that our team can match their rice. Our team scores on LN look very good in practice; we just need to show them off in the matches.

**Axelerrixx**: 

Canada and Hong Kong shall meet,

With skills both so fast and fleet,

Tension will be high,

As notes fly by,

Our showdown will be a treat.

**Twitch chat**: I think we are a very consistent team so i'm hoping we will at least 3-way FC most of the maps, depending on how hard the QF map pool is. For SV, I think it will be even; we choked really hard on qualifiers so our ranking on that isnt exactly representative of what we are capable of as a team. For the other skill sets we just have to hope things go our way. Misolato is super scary though.

**AmariaLove**: They have really good early game rice. Just hoping for the QFs not being too hard so we can beat them.
