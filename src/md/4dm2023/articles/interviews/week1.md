## Italy

**The team had a reset and basically placed the same seeding this year. Kiraz, as the captain, you were expecting to seed higher than last year, how do you feel about that? What do you think went wrong?**

**Kiraz**: We had a lot of problems during team creation, me and my teammates were expecting a better placement but at end of the day considering what happened during qualifiers too, we take this seed heh.

**Being able to have a team reset and still being able to get a slot in the brackets is no joke. How will the team prepare for future matches?**

**Kiraz**: We are happy we still got to qualify with all the troubles, sadly our team is not the most balanced in early game so we will focus on that.

**Intermission Question! I’ve personally been asked to obtain a carbonara recipe for a broke person so please share your words of wisdom for cooking pasta if you have any.**

**Kiraz**: Here is THE REAL way to make a good carbonara:

Ingredients: Pasta (you can use spaghetti, mezze maniche or bucatini), Roman Pecorino cheese, black peppercorns, eggs and guanciale (it's the pig cheek, do not use bacon pls).

Put the water to boil (do not add too much salt because the guanciale is already really salt), take the guanciale and cut it large pieces (for reference, half pinkie), put the guanciale in a pan and let it cook. Meanwhile take only the yolks of the eggs (I personally use 1 per 100g of pasta) and put it in bowl, add the pecorino cheese and the black pepper and start to mix until you create a cream (pro tip: the guanciale releases fat when you cook it, you can add this to your "carbonara cream" )

Now, the water should be boiling, so take your pasta and start to cook it, once it's ready you can throw the pasta into the pan where you have cooked the guanciale (don't forget to turn off the fire), add the cream and start to mix (you can add a spoon of cooking water to make the cream less dense), once the pasta is super creamy you can add the guanciale, pepper and pecorino cheese again, and it's ready to eat!

**Awesome, hopefully you will see ur guide be relevant!**
 
**Your team is facing Brazil in Ro32, do you guys think you'll be able to snatch a point or even win against them?**

**Kiraz**: Brazil is an amazing team with incredible players, we always aim to win, it will be really hard and some would say impossible, but who knows? 

**What is Italy's strategy going into the fight against Brazil?**

**Kiraz**: Who needs a strategy when you have the power of pasta and pizza by your side...Anyway, all I can say is: consistency.

**Does the team have anything to say to Brazil and the rest of the tournament players? Any words of wisdom?**

**Kiraz**: WE WILL BRING YOU PIZZA IF YOU LET US WIN GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN 

## Nicaragua

**A new and fresh team has risen to the challenge of 4 Digit MWC! It always feels good to see new faces in this tournament. Team Nicaragua, how do you feel getting a spot in the Top 32?**

**KevinRJF**: First of all, I feel genuinely proud of my teammates, they’ve became also my friends because of this game, and I know we reached this point not only because of our great effort and practice, but because of the great motivation they showed me throughout this Qualifiers stage. 

**LLB_BBX**: Feels unreal, somehow we made it in but at the same time it's like I lose hope, the fact that we're going against Singapore as the first round sucks, there is no hate against them anyways.

**Art_Trits55**: It feels like a dream, I've always wanted to go far in a competitive game, and even though I wasn't there last year, we all improved and managed to qualify, I'm proud of our team that we managed to get this far.

**Blenkchl**: This is crazy for me, I mean, since I met the 4-digit MWC back in 2020, I have always was thinking about qualifying in this tournament with the people I met in this videogame from my same country and when I saw we got in the seed 32 I was almost crying because of the happiness and success I felt. Secondly, it feels highly gratifying to see how we are able to show a bit of our country’s potential, and I’m sure in a future we’ll see a lot more skillful faces than today.

**The team actually clutched the 32nd seed and even beating New Zealand for that spot. Your whole team is also new to the tournament scene, what kind of improvements would you do for the future?**

**KevinRJF**: I strongly believe each one of us has a unique ability that is really difficult to see in others. I am sure my teammates can now start to stand out if they want and improve day after day what they already have. As I said before, we achieved this through practice, but mostly because of our big Nicaraguan motivation. I feel extremely proud of being able to be Top 1 in this country full of potential, and to be the one who will contentedly open the doors to the next players who will soon take my place.

**LLB_BBX**: My main goal right now it's to improve my skill in 7k and I also want to skill boost at any cost, and if it's possible, I want to be better than the top 1 and 2 of my country. It looks easier than beating Singapore.

**Art_Trits55**: We are trying to improve in all areas, although personally, due to my studies, I could not be very present at osu! I love this game and I always like to improve more.

**Blenkchl**: All our members were trying their best and doing everything to make it possible and it was a total surprise, but entering into seed 32 made us realize that we still need to improve a lot on things like ratio or getting better in some skill sets. We are gonna put some effort into getting better and better, hoping to qualify in next year's MWC with probably new members too :D.

**Unfortunately, you're going to face the #1 seed, Singapore, in the Round of 32, how do you all feel about that?**

**KevinRJF**: I feel that is what should happen, having qualified in this tournament is already an achievement itself, so it doesn't bother me at all to compete against a country that showed their great skills wonderfully. Now it is our turn to give everything against them, regardless of the consequences. 

**LLB_BBX**: We just don't have any chance against them. The skill that they have is unreal, but at the same time I feel happy to fight against good players, I get more motivation than before to get better at this game.

**Art_Trits55**: We're screwed, but it doesn't discourage me, my dream was always to be in a tournament like this, and it came true and I'm very proud of it.

**Blenkchl**: I remember Kevin and me when we were watching the qualifiers streaming and getting demotivated thinking about the possible rivals, but we are sort of happy about playing against Singapore. When I talked with them a few days ago I met them better and now I feel that we couldn't get any team better than them, the feelings I got from watching their qualifiers' scores and getting close to them were more like adrenaline and competitiveness and I hope our team at least can win 1 round against them.

**I'm really happy that you qualified this year, would the team expect to seed higher next iterations of the game? Do you still want to join next year?**

**KevinRJF**: I really enjoy this experience, I did last year as well, I already know how this works and I always have a great time with my peers, but I think that in order for this to continue getting better, we must do it differently.

**LLB_BBX**: You can be good, but never good enough. 

**Art_Trits55**: I will say that, never give up, you can always improve more and more, it doesn't matter if it is a small progress, soon you will go far for your perseverance, I spent 1 year and a half playing almost every day to get to this level, I know that the singapore team is good because of this, so even if we lose, i won't be ashamed to lose against a good player. 

**Blenkchl**: As I said before, all the effort we'll be putting into achieving more things in this game, will make a difference in our actual skill level. We are looking forward to getting into the tournament again and trying to get even in the higher seeds.

**Does the team have anything to say to the Singapore team and the rest of the tournament players? Any words of wisdom?**

**KevinRJF**: I usually love to dream big and ahead, and that has led me to what I am today, so I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone reading this, to put great effort into whatever you do and enjoy doing. I congratulate the Singapore team, a multicultural country and a symbol of modernity, with hugely dedicated players.  I'm sure these guys will do amazing in this tournament and in all the others they will play later on. Thank you very much everyone for being able to have me in this tournament, I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do, and may the best team win.

**Blenkchl**: I have faith in Singapore getting a high rank this year and maybe being the winner so cheers to them and also to everyone on the MWC!! Don't feel sad because you lose a match, enjoy every play you do and try your best.

## Singapore

**Hello Team Singapore! I must say, very outstanding performance during your qualifiers, I'm sure your practice must've paid off.**

**Your first bracket round will start this weekend! What will you be most afraid of when playing against other teams in future rounds?**

**McButt**: I may miss on nothing on an easy map

**riunosk**: I hope my kb doesn't drop input

**TheOPmeme**: I may miss on nothing

**awdse22**: Any pressure and nerves. I feel that regardless of how good our score is, these are the only factors that aren't really in our control and it is really what creates the idea of "anything can happen", especially in earlier game where one small drop can really determine losing a point. While being seeded high gives us a bit of advantage as for who we go against, that does not make us invulnerable. In late game, when getting closer to the podium, this has an even greater tendency to really bring down our scores massively if it gets out of control.

**icxfire**: Mindblock + keyboard dropping input

**Neon-Hooray**: Some maps may be too hard for me to play

**Knowing each of your strengths and limitations as an overall team, how would you guys prepare yourselves for future stages?**

**McButt**: I think i will only be relevant for early game so i will play ranked maps until it becomes late game then i can tidur

**riunosk**: I'd focus on my strengths which is rice and ratio in general to help out whenever possible

**awdse22**: With my greatest weakness being skillcap, compared to the team there aren't really many other aspects which i can contribute to, especially when even in early game my ratio may not be good enough. Personally I don't really have much preparation to do on my own part aside from practicing the SV maps (as I am expected to)

**TheOPmeme**: We carry SV

**icxfire**: Study our opponents and adapt to their skillset, while training physicality and accuracy

**Neon-Hooray**: That will be something for the readers to guess ;)) We will not reveal anything about that.

**As a team, what was the hardest qualifier map to be consistent with? What was the reason behind these inconsistencies?**

**McButt**: Stage 1, like alot of people pointed out and hated that one slowjam trill thingy was so difficult to not explode on

**riunosk**: Stage 7, the anchors are unforgiving and also forcing a lot more stamina emphasis on one hand at a time.

**TheOPmeme**: Stage 2, if you cant control your nerves, youre dead.

**icxfire**: Stage 7, Middle part feels hard to adapt to after the jumpstreams.

**Neon-Hooray**: Stage 4 requires way to much finger independence to pull of the strict releases.
 
**Do you guys think you’ll be able to exceed your expectations with your qualifier scores?** 

**McButt**: Yes, because i had lower scores for every map i played other than stage 6 :(

**riunosk**: unsure, sometimes i'm quite consistently inconsistent

**awdse22**: I think we really performed better than we thought we would in terms of seeding and with a lot of insane players from other countries in 4dm, we might be able to do better than what we initially thought we would in terms of tournament performance. As for whether we're satisfied with our qualifiers, we may be satisfied with our seeding but not as much for our personal scores as we feel that we really have the potential to score even better.

**TheOPmeme**: I need my coffee buff then maybe.

**icxfire**: i think that i could have possibly done better if my consistency was better during the qualifiers

**Last year, Singapore seeded 11th in 4DM4, This year, you guys have come and kicked off 4DM2023 with an outstanding 1st seed (2nd time since 4DM1). Although you guys are a very strong team, is there any country in particular you are most afraid facing against?**

**riunosk**: China. They seem to pose a notable challenge for us.

**awdse22**: China. With our LN not being as strong as other skillsets (based on qualifiers) and a lot of their scores being close to ours even if it's lower in addition to how all-rounded they are, we do have the least certainty in winning against them if we were to play against them.

**TheOPmeme**: Malaysia. they are constant.

**icxfire**: Malaysia. Their long note is potentially stronger than us + with our current standard they could possibly beat us

**Neon-Hooray**: USA seems to be a scary team, all of them are experienced and skilled. Going up against them would be a nightmare

**AdamAckerville and sukidayo-, You guys were part of the 4DM tryout staff for the Singapore Team. After the Qualifier results, do you have anything to say to the Media Centre or Singapore Team?**

**AdamAckerville**: At first I actually planned to host the tryouts but funk came above and carried. I did most of the testplay and we collectively put against this set of team members in the roster. While they are playing in the qualifiers I was watching along and thought they did well. They didn't throw too hard on the maps and each member got a very solid team score, especially on stage 3 when they each collectively got an average score of 997k which was insane. Seeing them placing seed #1 in the qualifiers made me really happy and I didnt expect it in the slightest as I was thinking they would place around the top 5 range. I'm glad I was able to be apart of the staff team helping out the new gen players who will be taking over me now (except riunosk and awdse22) for possibly even the main event, the 4KMWC 2023. Now a word from me to all the players playing in 4dm. awdse stop being so good at SV thank you cuz you're making funk's bank empty with the bounties. McButt I am glad I got intocontact with you quite early on and see you develop into such an accuracy monster and my LN successor (about time). icxfire keep having your coffee buff and fix LN release ratio please thanks especially on Dance Number :). OPMeme you pop out of nowhere and basically unheard of and you made it to the team despite having 16 other competitors, keep going ham dude you're gonna be big. Neon the horror lets make your accuracy better in the future for future tournaments you may participate in and keep making maps, dont let people's comment get over you. Last but not least the kapitan riunosk, I am happy and glad to see you still around playing this game and guiding these new gen players into the tournament scene, preparing them for the big bois. Now I wanna give my appreciation to the people who helped out in the sg tryouts. Shiro thank you for being the backup if I died and guiding the players along with you mostly. Funk we couldnt have done this without you, thanks a lot.

**sukidayo-**: The moment I saw many of the new up-and-rising players exhibiting such immaculate potential in tournament ability. I knew that there would be so many wasted prospects if we didn't form the current 4DM team. It's no surprise to say the very reason I wanted to be involved in all of this was due to the fact that I could envision Singapore making it far, perhaps winning the competition and therefore relentlessly bugged Funk at the start to let me be part of this journey :') In my opinion, I didn't have a shadow of doubt where Singapore could at least qualify within the Top 6 but Top 1 came with so many varied and haphazard emotions, happiness, disbelief, shock, but the one sentiment that triumphed over the rest was inconceivable relief and consolidation. I had high hopes for the team from the start, and thank god their efforts weren't put to waste. As a former 4DM player from the 3rd edition, it's awe-inspiring that this group of people I know, friends,  could do that well, especially since some of them have only been playing a miniscule number of years compared to other competent players. Often times you'll see me being not taking things seriously and it's genuinely hard to tell, but with utmost earnesty, I absolutely love this team <3.

**Finally, how confident are you guys in making it far to the tournament?**

**McButt**: I'm pretty confident in making it far because I have the power of friendship

**riunosk**: I am confident that we can at least hit semifinals

**awdse22**: Seeing how perform and the team roster I do feel confident with our skill... however (speaking from past experience), there are many things that could happen and I wouldn't want to be too sure yet.

**TheOPmeme**: Our team is in shambles. We were probably in for a far ride and aimed to get a 4DM cat. WE NEEDED IT. WE LOVE POLY AND SINGAPORE.

**icxfire**: Fairly. I believe that our individual skillsets would allow us to make it very far due to most of us being able to play maps fairly late into the pool.

**Neon-Hooray**: 4dm could and will have many unexpected twists and turns. With all past tournaments turning out in such a way, it becomes very unpredictable as comebacks may occur, chokes may happen, I honestly cannot expect much. But I will do my best to help my team to go as far as possible into the tournament!

**AdamAckerville**: I am confident that singapore can reach at least finals during the toughest condition such as scheduling, unavailability and others. But I think they are able to take home the W if they try their very best, I believe in the kids.

**sukidayo-**: I'm not a person with great credence, but in my honest judgement, this is the greatest 4DM team Singapore has ever come by and regardless of results, I'm still proud of however far they can make it :OOO!!!

**Thanks for your answers! Any final words you wanna give to Team Nicaragua or to the participating teams?**

**McButt**: We are all clowns in one big clown car.

**riunosk**: All the best Nicaragua!

**awdse22**: Always cool to see teams from countries not normally seen in many country tournaments, good luck on all of your matches!

**TheOPmeme**: We will pain in accordance to what we can, good luck, have fun :)

**icxfire**: We love you Nicaragua!

**Neon-Hooray**: Hope we have a good game up ahead!
