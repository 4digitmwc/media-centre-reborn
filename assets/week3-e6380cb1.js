<h2>Antagonism</h2>
<p>Walking through the fields of Zion does not feel as liberating as Earth did. It lacks the abundance of grass to touch, flowers to smell, and the fauna to adore. More importantly, even if they did exist, I would not be able to see any of it in its full glory. It is a depressing reality to not know how to feel, even when i innately know how to do that. All I can tell, is that the celestial sea above us is eternally black, with the sparsely populated stars occasionally shining brighter then usual. They simply felt like polka dots in the void, which felt ever so familiar to me that it almost gave me <em>deja vu</em>. I could never really put my words to clearly explain what that was.</p>
<p>Trudging along the streets of a normally desolate town, a huge crowd of people huddled around at the entrance of a derelict building. It was needless to say that something weird was happening down there. Naturally curious as I was, I decided to head down to that building and figure out the situation.</p>
<p>Squeezing through the huge crowd and reaching the middle where everyone kept a distance from something, I saw that something. I could not return what I saw to the void, and could only burn that moment into the retina of my eye.</p>
<p>It was a body. A lifeless one, partially submerged in a pool of dark liquid, oozing out from a white mattress that could not house all of it. Even without knowing the color of the liquid, I could well recognize it was not something to feel pleasant about. The rotting stench also told me directly that this was blood. An abnormally public murder supposedly took place right in this building.</p>
<p>People gossiped among themselves. Some feared the sight and looked away from it. Some pointed to the body and made ridiculous speculations of what could have happened to the victim; Brutally murdered in her sleep, taken her own life, et cetera. Any theory you could conjure up, really. There was no way of knowing her cause of death either - she had no open wounds on her body, simply a body pale and wrinkled, potentially from the loss of too much bodily fluids and blood. Looking around her body, it didn’t seem like there were any identification cards or plaques that could possibly show her identity either. The identity of this person, the murderer, their motives… I would not be able to tell for sure.</p>
<p>Amongst this confusion, another lady walked out onto the middle court. She bore a stick with multiple white flags attached to them, and wore loose garments of a singular shade of dark grey which I could not make out the color of. The moment she stood out, she withheld an aura of strong charisma, quelling the rumors of the crowd. Staring right into the eyelids of the lifeless body and twirling her stick for a little, she chanted monotonously against the silence,</p>
<p><em>“This person, she was brutally murdered. It is up to all of us witnesses here, to find the murderer.”</em></p>
<p>Amongst the crowd, there were worried woes and frightened gasps. Strangers started to estrange each other, taking steps back from unfamiliar faces. Others seemed to freeze in their steps, and pull out their karate stances. The meeker ones, huddled together in fear. It was obvious that the thought of having a cold-blooded murderer in our midst was a harrowing thought to have. Or what’s worse than that, an invasive alien species that holds no sympathy for us, whatsoever.</p>
<p>Many started to whisper to themselves about the scriptures, detailing the history, chemistry and biology of this planet:</p>
<p><em>“Legends say that Zion used to be home to aliens who killed everyone who wasn’t of their kind. By any chance, do these aliens hide among us?”</em></p>
<p><em>“The scriptures told us that these aliens are unable to see color. Surely all color blind people are the aliens themselves?”</em></p>
<p>Standing in the middle of the circle drawn out by the crowd, isolated, I could feel my blood receding, a wave of cold sweat and goosebumps from within me. I was clear as day that I did not kill anyone with my own hands in the time I was conscious, Yet, it seems like I was going to be first in line to be prosecuted.</p>
<p>To my confusion, a wave of petrification seemed to also permeate the whole crowd. Many flinched in their spots, yet they were unwilling to make a sound. All of them seemed to nod and agree furiously, yet it also seemed like they did something wrong. They seemed equally confused about the reality as they were afraid of the aftermath of this meet. It is as if we wanted to own up, but could not. We were all ready to run from this body, away from the impending chaos that faces us, right at our feet.</p>
<p>After a few moments of silence, not knowing what to say, someone said the words, the words that would plunge the utopia we built with our own hands, into endless chaos and suffering.</p>
<p><em>“So, who would like to identify the color of this box? You, my big, strong, young man standing in front of the body like this?”</em> A random middle-aged man stared into my eyes and pointed right at my chest, like a knife being thrust into my chest, as if I should be executed.</p>
<p>It was that moment where I knew, that was the Pandora’s Box open for all of us. There was no way to escape the witch hunt that has just been declared, with any wisdom. This was irrational fear overtaking the citizens of Zion, and there was no aura for reconciliation at this time. For me to run, it was now or never.</p>
<p>Tilting up my head to meet my eyes with the girl with the stick, I made a run for it. Grabbing her tightly by the hand, I immediately pushed my way out of the crowd before anyone could react fast enough to stop me in my tracks. Surprisingly, she did not stop me from leaving at all, and simply ran with me, albeit without a trace of fear or dread etched on her face.</p>
<p>Behind me, chaos started to unfold amongst the citizens still in the crowd. Many cried and pleaded to the people who drew out objects of many unrecognizable colors and asked them to answer with the right color. There were also some who attempted to run away from the whole situation as I did, but being a few moments too late for that meant a different fate, for they were held captive by strong, young men who assumed themselves to be able to see color. Even if they were color-blind themselves, they had to pretend to see color. It was the only way they would be able to escape from the scenario alive and see another day. Needless to say, there was no order or grounds for reasoning. Only senseless murder and lynching was left for us in the wake of this chaos.</p>
<p>As we furiously dashed back into the ETI Research Lab headquarters, I could still hear the faint cold gunshots and blood-curdling screams from behind. Closing the bulletproof doors of the laboratory behind us, I finally took a good look at the girl I just saved from the crowd. She seemed calm as ever, not a single sweat broken. Her outfit seemed to be out of this world as well, it was that of a shrine maiden’s outfit. I could not really make out who she was, but there is one thing I knew for sure:</p>
<p>She is not from this universe, and holds some spiritual power. Yet, she stumbled upon this place and is now placed among this chaos. It was my job to figure out what she might have got to do with this incident, and what she could do to potentially help save Zion from sinking into internal war and death.</p>
<p>That night, it was as clear to me as day, that we had to find out who murdered the lady at the door. It was our only saving grace for the world.</p>
