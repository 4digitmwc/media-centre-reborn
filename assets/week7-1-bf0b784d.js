Canada, China and Singapore",subtitle:"What are the afterthoughts of China after winning, Singapore after trying their best to challenge them, and Canada who secured the third place of this tournament!",authors:["porkisgreat"],table_of_contents:!0},t=`<h2>Canada</h2>
<p><strong>I know it wasn't a great match so I won't make you go into detail. Canada lost 0-7. I'm going to guess that you guys didn't had a full roster + time cucked into how you guys went into your match against singapore correct?</strong></p>
<p>Axelerrixx: We actually did have a full roster. I think we were all in the vc. We just got skillcapped which was very sad.</p>
<p>svp-: we just weren't playing very well at the time of the match</p>
<p>Axelerrixx: (I also got 5 hours of sleep the night before :troll:)</p>
<p>twitch chat: i mean i think the time might have messed up my warmup a little bit but i dont think it would have mattered, i got skillcapped on rice pretty hard</p>
<p>Axelerrixx: To be fair Singapore has like 2 delta level players. We did our best.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless, Canada will be finishing in the Top 3 for the first time ever in 4DMWC. How does the voices feel knowing you guys will be going away with a banner &amp; some cash, while also making history for the country in this tournament?</strong></p>
<p>Robert6400: The voices in my head love it</p>
<p>Axelerrixx: Forza Horizon 8</p>
<p>Ok but in all seriousness I am happy placing on the podium. Every member gets $20 USD ($27 CAD), I will use my prize money to rent igloo since I live in cardboard boite.</p>
<p>twitch chat: the voices are pretty happy about third place</p>
<p><strong>I want to ask each one of you guys with the assumption that skillbans isn't a factor to your decisions, but do you guys see yourself returning to 4DMWC 2024 if that will happen?</strong></p>
<p>Axelerrixx: Nope. I feel like farming</p>
<p>twitch chat: Yeah probably not</p>
<p>svp-: Probably not. Tournament play has been too stressful.</p>
<p>Robert6400: Nope. Mappool too hard + not fun. Will try to farm but WILL fail + quit w (?)</p>
<p>svp-: Robert u should keep on playing tournament. You have a lot of potential to be a very scary player. Maybe this tourney wasn't a good first experience. Don't quit w</p>
<p>Robert6400: meh maybe after the etterna/mint mappool trend is done</p>
<p>twitch chat: 4DM was really fun both years and I met a lot of cool people but I don't think I can do it again. Always stressing about doing good.</p>
<p>AmariaLove: 4dm was a really fun experience, but i do not believe returning to it is in my plan. The only thing I'll say to them is, as long as you keep mint's clique outside the mapping of the tournament. You guys will be running this tournament for years to come. Mappool is too op on 4DM.</p>
<p>svp-: it's been really fun.</p>
<p>Robert6400: In all seriousness i do not 100% consider doing 4DM again thinking of how the mappool will only get harder and harder, i am after all an early/mid game player and you never know what could happen in a year from now; i was after all ~9-7k a year ago.</p>
<p>svp-: outside of MWC, i might be done with mania tournament</p>
<p>twitch chat: I don't think I ever interacted with the mania community. Until I signed up for 4DM last year.</p>
<p><strong>Well regardless, it was nice to see you guys perform in this year's 4DMWC! Best of luck to everyone's future endeavors!</strong></p>
<p>svp-: Thanks pork for your amazing work in 4DM!</p>
<p>twitch chat: The media center was always really fun to read, the amount of effort you put into it was amazing.</p>
<p>Canada: Pork mutual? :plead:</p>
<p>Sure! (Mutuals Team Canada)</p>
<h2>Singapore</h2>
<p><strong>It was a close battle between you and China. What saw hope from Singapore was the championship in sight as they won the first match 7-5, but unfortunately, China was able to defeat Singapore once and for all to become 4DMWC 2023 Champions. I don't need to explain, but what I want to know is how did the match happened for you guys from the start to finish?</strong></p>
<p>McButt: Our plan going into this match was to beat them on every rice pick and then gain bonus points on sv. Knowing full well china would almost certainly win all ln and most hb picks, i wasn't too worried playing ln as losing them would still be according to plan. But I was having a bad session which pretty much wrecked any chance of gaining extra points on LN. And of course we were essentially all passing out after the bracket reset while china had just about infinite stamina?? :0 lord forbid me playing the last hybrid pick LOL</p>
<p>awdse22: To start off, some of us just barely made it in time for the match to warm up and things started off a bit chaotic. Other than that it's mainly me just insisting to play the warm up I mapped because I spent over a month mapping it.</p>
<p>The first match went pretty much as some of us expected, we kind of knew that there are maps couldn't get points off from with China until some of us saw our chance in hybrid 2 (which seemed to be the most rice oriented hybrid as far as I know? I never really played the other maps).</p>
<p>The moment the 2nd match started, some of us started getting tired (opmeme being the first one to take a hit from the fatigue). For me the moment I realized that, I already knew that we lost the match, especially speaking from one of my experiences from a bracket reset which I took part before in one of the other tournaments (ironically it's also singapore against china), bracket reset is basically game of endurance if there isn't a team particularly far ahead. With that as a few maps were played, more fatigue kicked in and most of us accepted that we already lost, so we just played for fun after that.</p>
<p>Neon-Hooray: Honestly, it was not the finish that we wanted but we already knew how strong their ln was since the finals. We were expecting them to pick everything LN oriented. On the other hand, we had a slight advantage in rice so we were going for rice picks to get some points. Something which I noticed was that China usually smoked our scores on LN while we barely beat them on rice, you could imagine how difficult it was to maintain the consistency on our rice picks, especially when they are really physically demanding. I did not expect the pool to be this difficult, and it is clear that both teams struggled on the maps. Because we originally came from the Losers' Bracket after losing to China, we needed to win twice in order to become the Champions which is really hard. We barely won the first match and got a bracket reset, this was thanks to the Hybrid pick being more jack oriented (Thanks Funk). Once the 2nd match initiated, many of us were already feeling heavy amounts of fatigue. Although China also experienced this as well, they were still able to hold up stronger than us. We knew at that point that there is no way we could win the 2nd match unless something drastic happens on China's end. It was a well earned victory by China and I would like to wish them a congratulations because they performed extremely well. I am glad that we had 3 amazing matches and each one was able to entertain the audience.</p>
<p>oyama mahiro: Our plan for the match was to generally trade points back and forth until hybrid 2, where we were hoping to get the break point off them due to it being the most rice oriented hybrid (we knew they were saving hb2 for last due to the sheer difficulty of it). This strategy worked as we managed to get the first break point and trigger a bracket reset. However playing for nearly 3 hours tired us out and we lost our consistency in the second half of the match eventually leading to our loss.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless, Singapore will finish in 2nd place. The highest place this country has finished in 4DMWC. I know you guys really don't care about history (ex: SFs interview), but knowing you guys went far, how did you guys feel about your performance throughout this tournament?</strong></p>
<p>McButt: I think I did my part in terms of LN and especially sv which I'm not too proficient at yet. Although I did choke a few too many times on LN picks for no reason, but they do happen ig. I definitely was not expecting the huge difficulty spike as compared to last edition though which made me useless on rice much earlier than expected. Nonetheless 2nd place is definitely nothing to be ashamed of and like yea wp china (i love you molli owo)</p>
<p>awdse22: For my personal performance, (I guess this sounds a bit outrageous) I'm personally not very satisfied with my scores in matches, though chokes do happen from time to time so I still accept it. As much as I did pretty well with regards to SV scores, I do wish that I'll be able to perform at my peak in matches. Aside from that, I'm basically too physically incapable to contribute in other areas in the tournament which kind of sucks but oh well, I am basically the only 4 digit player in my team after all :^). Ultimately I guess I did play my role in the team.</p>
<p>Neon-Hooray: Personally, I felt a little disappointed in myself. Mainly because I underperformed many times. Majority of my scores were not up to par and could have been improved. I was in Singapore's 4DM team due to my late game capabilities but I was unable to perform up to standard. My teammates on the other hand had been contributing so much to earn the Champion spot for us. McButt being our accuracy and LN player, he was able to win against many other countries especially early game wise, which is something I would have never been able to do for our team. riunosk as well for being an amazing ratio and rice player, he gets many 990k scores throughout all the different mappools from start to finish. TheOPmeme was an amazing all-rounder that was able to support our team in every single section, rice, hybrid and LNs. oyama mahiro (icxfire) also another all-rounder who has amazing ratio, even beating the China team's biggest player [GB]Mafufu in accuracy on multiple occasions. Last but not least, awdse22, an AMAZING SV player capable of setting MWC level SV scores and remains in the 990k score zone in pretty much every single SV map throughout 4dm23. They all did their part to push Singapore forward, winning rounds against other countries. However, when my turn came, I was unable to do so, losing to China in both Finals and Grand Finals. I personally felt that I did not do my part in building Singapore its potential biggest victory yet in mania. I joined 4dm for the profile badge (as shown by the multiple occasions I mentioned it) after I saw many other players having the same thing on their profile, it would be cool to have one on my own profile too. Some of us also joined 4DM because we saw that we could do really well and even earn a victory in the tournament. It was quite a big goal that we had. Having these high standards set on myself made me feel guilty that I could not contribute as much as I wanted to.</p>
<p>In the end, I learnt very much that all of this did not really matter too much and we were supposed to have fun playing. I am glad to have met such an amazing team. Thank you to all my teammates for staying alongside with me, it is a very enjoyable experience that I had!</p>
<p>oyama mahiro: Personally I was pretty happy with my performance especially since it was a massive improvement from finals ( wished I could have done better then though ). I got quite a few pbs in match and I was generally content with the scores I got. However, like I said, my finals performance was fairly disappointing and if we had not lost so many break points in that match the final victor of the tournament may have been different. Still, second place is still a great accomplishment and i'm proud to be part of such a great team :D (WP China we love yall &lt;3)</p>
<p><strong>What does the future hold for you guys after this tournament? Will we see you guys move up to compete in 4KMWC 2023? Or will this tournament motivate you all to achieve your individual goals?</strong></p>
<p>McButt: I'm almost definitely not going MWC my skill is NOT there at all lol and i've been taking a break for awhile but i'll be back for like gbc (singaporean spy :imp:) and combro cup 2 if it happens maybe yes pls :0 and maybe more if I see something interesting</p>
<p>awdse22: As for what I'm planning to do in the future, personally I don't really have much I want to pursue in terms of skill in general. With regards to tournament participation, I likely won't be taking part in tournaments anymore due to... personal reasons (but things do happen) even though SVSE seemed appealing to me. For 4K MWC I already took part in it once and probably never again.</p>
<p>For individual goals, I never really had much in mind and even for older ones such as every world cup participation, I kind of just lost motivation. As of now, I'm really just planning to enjoy the game just as I have for the past year, free from pressure and doing whatever I want to do for fun.</p>
<p>Neon-Hooray: What does the future hold for me? I have spent a lot of time practicing for 4dm and it is extremely time consuming, being competitive is tough already for top players and it would be even harder for me to go against such amazing people, especially in bigger tournaments such as 4KMWC 2023. There is a big likelihood that I would probably not participate in anymore future mania tournaments because I tend to pressure myself, which many people have already told me is unhealthy. I would rather devote the time I have to my personal life and relationships with relatives. Tournaments could collide with any kind of family gatherings, especially 4dm which was during the Lunar New Year season.</p>
<p>Once again, congratulations to China for winning 4DM 2023! Thank you to all the staff members for putting together such an amazing tournament.</p>
<p>oyama mahiro: For future tournaments, I probably won't be playing to win them anymore but if I find a tournament interesting and fun I might decide to join for the experience. In terms of 4KMWC2023 there's a small possibility that I might show up but knowing the scores top players can set compared to me I feel that I might not be able to contribute that greatly to the team as while I might not be playing to win, my teammates might be. And I do not want to jeopardize their chances of winning. Anyways a tournament i'm interested in as of now is combro cup 2 so expect to see me there :imp:</p>
<h2>China</h2>
<p><strong>Congratulations on winning the 4DMWC tournament! Can I get your thoughts on your victory against Singapore? It was a tough battle but you guys managed to win it all today!</strong></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu： Singapore is indeed a strong team, I am in awe! Thank you for your hard work and for contributing an epic showdown to 4DM! The victory over Singapore was something I hadn't expected, like a myth. But who will recoil? Without a challenge to God, how can we finally become a legend? Try to face the hard journey and don't look back, then there's one day that will show you the future! After winning the championship, and hearing TB's music again, I felt real, very different, like, the final poem? Triumphal song? It doesn't matter, I really love the tiebreaker.</p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233: First of all, I would like to thank all the audience for their support, all the staff for their efforts, and all the opponents for a wonderful game. Defeating Singapore in the Grand Finals was something we didn't expect, and we said in the last interview that GF mappool is an absolutely STRONG advantage for Singapore. Singapore is an extremely strong team, and the victory over Singapore is the result of the right time and place. Thank you again to everyone and wish Singapore all the best results in other tournaments.</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: It wasn't easy. We all did the best we could. I got 10 PB in 9 charts during the match, and my teammates were brave too, I could not recover for a long time. The next day, I was on the verge of tears when I watched the match again. Team Singapore is really a strong and respectable opponent. We have almost no difference in overall ability. If they play any better, we will not be able to handle them. Thank you Team Singapore, and I hope all Singapore players can achieve better results in tournaments!</p>
<p>Molli： I trust my teammates unreservedly!! And I played my own picture and cheered my teammates on at the same time. In fact, that kind of mappool has nothing to do with me, all I could do was trust my teammates, and my teammates had not disappointed everyone! From doubting yourself to believing in yourself to overcoming yourself, everyone has come along the way. Thank you too to the Singapore team for putting on such a wonderful GF showdown with us.</p>
<p>Zyuuu: ggwp！ This victory was something we never expected, Singapore resulted with so high scores against Canada that we didn't see any hope of winning, all I had to do was to practice as hard as I could on the pitch and trust my teammates. It turns out we did. Singapore's performance is undoubtedly very brave, and it is an honor to be your opponent and bring you all a wonderful grand final.</p>
<p><strong>You guys used the bracket reset after losing 5-7 against Singapore. But however, China managed to bounce back and defeat Singapore 7-2! Compared to the first match, it was based on results that China didn't improve on most of the scores after the first match, but Singapore really struggled to repeat their same performance against China. Was there a certain strategy that China did differently or did you guys go for the same strategy since the start of the Grand Finals?</strong></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu: Actually, I have a latent strategy. Since we could only guarantee to win all LNs and two HBs but there is also a reset, then we can rest assured to collect scores from our opponent Singapore. In the meantime, what we have to do is to maintain our strength and continue to work hard in good shape at Bracket Reset. Singapore didn't have a reset and I don't think they would give up any LN and HB until they got the breakpoint, so the score would be real and they would try their best, and it would consume a lot of stamina and energy. This can give us a lot of confidence in Bracket Reset. At the same time, we can also collect RC scores, which showed that the opponent's scores were similar to ours on some RCs, and these would be our breakpoints. That's right, we managed to break RC6, and with just one break, the opponent's confidence plummets, and this was even their 1st pick, this is a psychological tactic. It can be seen that our performance in RC3 was not good, but the map is indeed very long, why not maintain a little physical strength? As well as RC1 that was not selected, have I considered whether it is because our SF and Finals extraordinary JS play has caused Singapore to dare not choose the picture, or was it too weak to choose it? If it's the latter, then we're basically in hand, and RC4 in Bracket Reset could show this very well, and we can play with complete confidence. As for the two SVs, in fact, our training level is still relatively sufficient, but SV is a no-win item and does not consume much physical strength, and it is reasonable to ban either SVs. I was already inclined to play individual tournaments (because I could play anything), and the physical strength required for the three-hour race was just one more lap of the playground listening to a song. To sum up, GF tests more physical strength and psychology. No matter how difficult the mappool is and how hard the game is, we have firm faith, full confidence, and mutual trust, we will win! &quot;Keep the essence of your heart, and let it guide your way into the future.&quot; ----4DM Media centre.</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: Actually our strategy is still to keep all LN and HB points (We even never picked a RC map in the whole tournament, of course it is because all teams we met were RC-Skilled teams, but it's still interesting). Regarding the result before the bracket reset, we couldn't win such minijack HB maps like HB2. As the planner of the whole match, I decided to change the order of picking, referring to the difference in the match and protected LN4, which was banned by them before. Besides, I don't think there's a big gap between Singapore and us in streams and minijack techs, so we encouraged each other in our own voice channel because we wouldn't necessarily lose while playing them again, and the result confirmed my thought. Regarding our performance in bracket reset, we just performed as usual, but many players in Singapore cant keep stability cuz stamina crashes ( it is REALLY hard for 4 Digit players to keep the statement for 3 hours in such a difficult mappool ). So the conclusion is: We didn't change our strategy at all, just kept our performance similar to the 1st round. All in all, I believe this match can be one of the most wonderful matches in the history of 4DM. Thanks to all players and staffs who participated in this match!</p>
<p>lovely_hyahya： We just did our best, we were ready to play the reset at the beginning (for example, I bought a coffee and a functional drink, and at the beginning, Luoxuan was worried about whether drinking those two together would cause any bad effects, fortunately, it was just a slight stomach pain), and realized that this match was a protracted battle. I really admire Mafufuuu for playing steadily for three hours from the start to the end, I may not have played a lot, but I was well prepared and I am very happy with my scores.</p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233：there'were no strategies， just because of the power of AWMRone。（luoxuan said that he could only get a good score with the power of AWMRone）（in GBC， his team name is about AWMRone， and in this match， he lived in AWM's big house and AWMRone was playing Genshin at the same time）</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: AWMRone#1!!! I love this guy!</p>
<p>Molli: I don't have any words to say to this question lol. I only participated in SV and RC7, and my own strategy is to play as well as I can and be a thug to do what I need to do.</p>
<p>Zyuuu: My endurance has been pierced, from 6 o'clock to start the warm-up to 8 o'clock to start the game. In fact, after the first round of the jackmap I could not keep up with the physical strength, at that time I knew very well that once I stop to rest, my statement would fall to the bottom. So when I don't need to play on the field, I found maps with a certain strength to keep the statement. The second round of the match was no longer a battle between strength, everyone was fighting with endurance, gritting our teeth and insisting on every map, and finally, we resulted in a break point in RC6 with small differences. I must hold on to the hope of winning, and although I was tired, I told myself that I couldn't relax until the game was over, and I must have confidence.</p>
<p><strong>China has went from Top 4 back in 2019 in the first 4DMWC tournament, to now becoming champions of the fifth 4DMWC tournament. How does it feel knowing that you guys are not only making history for your country, but proving to everyone that the hard work that China is putting in all paid off in the end?</strong></p>
<p>[GB] Mafufu: Dreams come true. Sorry, I can't help seeing this question. Last round I said all I wanted was a Badge, no matter what the tournament was. Finally, on this day, I did it and got the World Cup Badge, a Badge I never thought I could get, a Badge that I could only dream about a long time ago. I actually never thought I would be on the stage of the world until MWC4K2022. After announcing my selection, I even felt like I was dreaming. Do I really have this strength? No, I didn't. I didn't recognize myself. But now, I recognize, I have done it to get everyone to recognize me, I have fulfilled my dream. I feel that the countless mental wounds I had suffered in my life over the past three years have healed at this moment. I can finally let go of my heart and climb up again. I would also like to thank all the players who participated in the competition, all the players who participated in the selection of various countries, as well as the players who paid silently in the background, the teammates of the MWC4K2022 Chinese team and coaches in team Crz who took me off and gave me courage, and our lovely 4DM2023 Chinese team comrades!</p>
<p>lovely_hyahya: It was like a dream. I watched the boiling QQ group chat lasting minutes of congratulations, post the memes of opening champagne and red envelopes, and I finally realized what a great victory. I have no regrets about the efforts I have made in these months.</p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233: After 7 weeks of racing, we were all very tired. It was just like a dream, our efforts got the perfect ending, and it is great.</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: I wasn't feeling well before the match, so I drank a can of Monster Energy to keep my statement, but I was too excited to sleep with the energy drink, so I didn't go to bed until 5 a.m., which made me lethargic and unable to do anything the next day lol. Before the result of the Qualifiers, I haven't thought about getting good ranks in such a competitive international tournament, the unique profile badge was definitely a joke. But as time goes by, I became confirmed that I, WE, deserve all honor. The moment we start on the 4DM knockout round, our goal should be the final champion. Eventually, we scratched this hard-won opportunity, and we can also announce our retirement in 4DM lol.</p>
<p>Molli: Actually, I received an invitation to the 4DM Chinese team in 2019, but at that time, I was busy with my studies and the focus of playing osu was mainly biased towards std, so I did not participate in the 4DM and the end I just became a bystander. But this time we seized the opportunity, accumulated so long of strength condensed, and wrote a strong stroke for Chinese 4K history. I believe that this victory is only the beginning, the future of Chinese 4K will create glory again.</p>
<p>Zyuuu: Let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooo</p>
<p><strong>What's the future of the Chinese team after this tournament? Will we see some of you guys in this year's 4k Mania World Cup to team up with the [Crz] players? Or will you continue to push for your own goals that you want to accomplish in this game?</strong></p>
<p>[GB] Mafufu: The selection of the MWC4K2023 Chinese team this year is different from the past, and I am one of the testers and participants. But well, academics are more important! After the college entrance examination, I should spend a lot of time travelling, the time to return to OSU! should not be very early, and I may not be able to get back to the key, and there are more strong players to replace me, so I will give the opportunity to other players! I actually passed the Beta Dan 16 months ago, but I can't pass the Gamma Dan and the Tachyon Dan until now, I have only recently stepped on the line in the LN 13 and xfpsb4 Dan Course (Mafufu's limitation is notoriously crotch-pulling), and I should try to enter Team Crz in the future, although I have been fantasizing about it two years ago. Here, I also hope that the MWC4K China team can also make history! I still hope that there will be players in the 4DM2023 Chinese team who will enter MWC4K. Maybe a little difficult though? It's okay! Someday it will be fine! Let's move on and set milestones farther afield!</p>
<p>lovely_hyahya: We are also very confident in next year's tournament, China has a huge quantity of players, and after this tournament, there is already a considerable amount of players that have indicated their willingness to participate in 4DM next year. Personally, I might take a break and I really enjoy this game. As a player, I achieved a milestone-like goal; As a Mapper, I also hope that people will enjoy my map, and I will aim for the next few months to put my goal on the Ranked Beatmap, and I hope everyone can see my name in the Ranked zone! In addition, it is unlikely that we will join forces with [Crz], because for now, [Crz] players cannot be four-digit players (who knows, will all four-digit players next year be tachyon or even delta?)</p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233: China has sufficient grassroots leagues and many outstanding talented players, and I believe that other Chinese players will continue to work hard and achieve good results in the future. As for MWC, the members of Crz are still unmatched by our 4DM team members (except for our Big Daddy Mafufu), and it is not realistic to join forces with them to perform in MWC in the short term, but I hope to have a chance in the future.</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: If you've been fascinated by him, the SUPER CARRY Mafufu during the 4DM2023, I believe you are looking forward to seeing him in MWC2023. Just wait and see! And for me, I think I'm not strong enough to participate in MWC, but I have to thank many skilled players in our country, like [Crz]Caicium, [Crz]Riko, [Crz]Flandre, Kuiiiiteeee, and [GB]Rysun, they practiced with us before the finals and helped us break the limitation, which played a big part in my performance. I would practice my mapping skill, participate in MCNC4K 2023, and still work as staff in GBC 2023 Spring. I'm still looking forward to the Chinese LN Tournament in the future. I'm really happy to see that domestic mania tournaments are becoming increasingly popular. Most importantly, I have to try to get a bachelor's degree and take part in the postgraduate entrance exams. So I would be really busy for the rest of this year and I'm not sure if I will afk in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Zyuuu: I'm just an ordinary osumania player, but I'm going to be stronger, I hope yall enjoy the game, and I wish yall a skill boost!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you so much China for the interview. I love China, I love Bing Chilling, and I love Super Idol. Best of luck in your future endeavors!</strong></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu: You love China, you love Bing Chilling, and you love Super Idol, but I love you. (it's enough hahahaha) I love 4DM, I love osu!! A place where my endless good memories are stored, a friend who will always be with me when I'm painful, an angel who heals me! Finally, thanks for being with us along the way! See you next time!</p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233: Thanks to the organizers, preparing for the tournament is too tiring, I prefer to play Genshin Impact for leisure XD, but my goal now is to finish the heavy homework in high school and do well in exams ()</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: I love 4DM, and I love my teammates. I love everyone I've got acquainted with in 4DM and hope to see yall again in other tournaments in the future!</p>
<p>Molli： i love you, you love me, mixue ice-cream and tea(an advertisement of a milk tea house lol)</p>
<p>Zyuuu： I really love the tiebreaker.</p>
<h2>China (original text)</h2>
<p><strong>祝贺你赢得了 4DMWC 锦标赛的冠军！我想知道你是如何在与新加坡的比赛中获胜的。能否请您谈谈对您战胜新加坡的看法？这是一场艰苦的战斗，但你们今天成功地赢得了所有的胜利!</strong></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu：新加坡的确是一支实力强队，我十分敬畏！感谢你们的辛苦付出，共同为4DM贡献了一场史诗对决！战胜新加坡队其实是我曾未预料的，如同神话一般。不过谁会就此退让呢？没有对神的挑战，怎会有成神的结局呢？努力去面对他，不要回头，会有一天，他会带你看到未来！夺冠过后，再次听到TB的音乐，感受真的，非常不一样，像是，终末之诗？凯旋之歌？无所谓啦，I really love the tiebreaker.</p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233：首先是感谢所有观众的支持，所有staff们的努力，所有对手们为大家展现的一场精彩的比赛。在总决赛战胜新加坡是我们未曾设想过的，在上一篇采访中我们也说过，gf是新加坡的绝对优势期，新加坡是一支极其强大的队伍，战胜新加坡是天时地利人和的结果。再次感谢所有人，并且预祝新加坡可以在明年的比赛中取得更好的成绩。（</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: 太不容易了，我们都做到了我们能做的最好。我打出了9张图10次pb，我的队友们更是一个比一个发挥神勇，我久久无法回过神来。在第二天补录像的时候，我简直要流下泪来。新加坡真的是非常强劲而可敬的对手，我们在赛图整体能力方面几乎可以说毫无差距，可能他们再发挥好一点我们就要顶不住了。感谢新加坡队，你们是可敬的对手，希望新加坡的各位选手可以在各大赛事取得更好的成绩！</p>
<p>Molli: 我毫无保留的相信队友！！我打好自己的图同时给队友加油打气。事实上这种图池和我已经没有什么关系了，我能做的只能是相信队友，而我的队友们也没有让大家失望！从怀疑自己再到相信自己再到战胜自己，这一路大家都走过来了。 也感谢新加坡队与我们共同演绎了一场如此精彩的gf对决。</p>
<p>Zyuuu: ggwp！这场胜利是我们从未预想过的，新加坡在与加拿大对决的出分非常高，高到我们看不到胜利的希望，我只能做的就是场上尽全力发挥，然后相信队友。事实证明我们的确做到了。新加坡的发挥无疑也是非常神勇，很荣幸能成为你们的对手，给大家带来精彩的总决赛。</p>
<p><strong>你们在 5-7 输给新加坡后，使用了包围圈重置。但是，中国队成功反弹，以 7 比 2 击败了新加坡队!  与第一场比赛相比，从结果来看，中国队在第一场比赛后的大部分分数都没有提高，但新加坡队真的很难重复他们对中国队的同样表现。是中国队有什么不同的策略，还是你们从总决赛开始就采取了相同的策略？</strong></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu：其实我有潜策略。我们既然只能保证所有LN和两张HB获胜，而且还有复活甲，那么我们放心去收集对手新加坡的分数。在此同时，我们要做到的是保持体力，在Bracket Reset以一个良好的状态继续努力。新加坡没有复活甲，我认为在他们拿到破发之前都不会放弃任何一张LN和HB，那么出分会很真实并且会尽全力，而且会消耗大量的体力和精力。这就可以给我们在Bracket Reset很大的信心。同时，也可以收集到RC的分数，可见，对手的分数在部分RC上与我们相差不多，而这些都将是我们的破发点。没错，我们做到了破发RC6，而只要有一次破发，对手的信心就会骤降，更何况是一选，这就是心理战术。可见，我们在RC3的发挥并不好，不过图确实很长，稍微保持一下体力又何乐而不为呢？以及没有被选出的RC1，我有考虑是否是因为我们SF和Finals的超常JS发挥导致新加坡不敢选图，或者是体力不支不敢选图？若是后者，那我们基本是胜券在握，在Bracket Reset中的RC4就很能感受到这一点了，我们也就可以完全放心打了。至于两个SV，实际上我们的练度还是比较充足的，不过SV是无胜率项并且不消耗太多体力，Ban掉任意一个SV都是合理的。而我本就倾向于打个人赛（因为啥都能打），三个小时的赛程需要的体力对于我来说只不过是听着歌跑操场多跑了一圈而已。综上所述，GF考验的，更多的是体力和心理。不论图池有多难，比赛有多么艰辛，我们有坚定的信念，有十足的信心，有彼此的信任，我们必胜！&quot;Keep the essence of your heart, and let it guide your way into the future.&quot;----4DM Media centre.</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: 事实上我们采取的策略仍然是有且仅有保住LNHB（我们甚至整届比赛都从未pick过任何一张rc图，当然也和我们只遇到了强常规队有关，但想起来还是蛮有趣的）。从第一轮的出分来看，我们在HB2这样的子弹图上不存在优势。作为全局的规划者，我决定根据第一轮的分差，在第二轮调整一下bp顺序，也就是按照分差从大到小来顺序选图，并且protect了他们ban掉的LN4。此外，我认为在乱和子弹tech方面，我们与新加坡的差距并不大，因此我们在语音里一直互相鼓励，同样的图再打一遍我们未必会输，事实上也正是如此。从第二轮的发挥来看，我们整体上还是中规中矩，但新加坡的很多队员在耐力上撑不住了（在这个强度下连打三个小时高难度图对四位数选手来说真的很难）。所以结论是：我们的策略并没有因为复活甲而改变太多，只是保持了第一轮的竞技状态。无论怎么说，我相信这也能成为4DM历史上最精彩的对局之一，感谢当时在场所有人的共同演绎！</p>
<p>lovely_hyahya：我们只是做到了我们的最好，我们一开始就做好了打复活赛的准备（比如我自己就买了一份咖啡和一份功能饮料，开始的时候落轩还担心两个一起喝会不会造成什么不好影响，还好只是轻微的肚子痛而已），意识到了这次比赛是场持久战。我非常佩服Mafufuuu能从开始打到结束三个小时还在稳定发挥，我上的场次可能不是很多，但是我上场的图都做好了充足的准备，我对自己的成绩非常满意。</p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233：我们没有战术，只有狙老头之力的帮助。（螺旋说每次他打赢关键局都和狙神有关系）（在GBC，他的队名有关狙神，在这场比赛中，他住在老头的大房子里，并且狙神在比赛的时候在爽玩原神）</p>
<p>Molli：哈哈，这个问题我没有任何发言权，我只参与了sv和rc7，我给我自己的策略就是能打多好打多好，当一个棋子去做好自己该做的。</p>
<p>Zyuuu：我的耐力已经被打穿了，从6点多开始热手，热到8点开始比赛，实际上第一轮打完那个叠我已经体力跟不上了，这个时候心里很清楚一旦我停下歇息，手一凉无论怎么热状态都会跌底，所以在场下不需要我上的图时，找一定强度的图保持手感。第二轮拼的已经不是实力，大家都在拼耐力，咬牙坚持每一张图，终于换来了小分差rc6破发。能看到赢的希望一定紧紧把握住，尽管很累但我告诉自己比赛没结束还不能松懈，一定要有信心。</p>
<p><strong>中国从 2019 年第一届 4DMWC 比赛的四强，到现在成为第五届 4DMWC 比赛的冠军。知道你们不仅为国家创造了历史，而且向大家证明了中国所付出的努力最终都得到了回报，这种感觉如何？</strong></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu：圆梦。抱歉，看到这个问题我有点忍不住了。上一轮我说我想要的就是一个Badge，无论是什么比赛都可以。终于，这天，我做到了，拿到了世界杯的Badge，一个我从未想过能得到的Badge，一个多久之前都只能在梦里幻想的Badge。我其实从来没有想过我能登上世界的大舞台，直到MWC4K2022。宣布被选入队过后，我甚至都觉得我是在做梦。我真的有这个实力吗？不，我没有。我没有认可我自己。但是现在，我认可了，我还做到了让大家认可我，我圆梦了。我感觉我这三年受到的生活中无数的精神创伤在这一刻都愈合了。我终于可以放下心再向上爬了。也要感谢所有参加比赛的选手，各位参与了各国选拔的选手，还有在后台默默付出的玩家们，以及带我起飞、给我勇气的MWC4K2022中国队的队友们和[Crz]的教练们，还有我们可爱的4DM2023中国队战友们！</p>
<p>lovely_hyahya：像一场梦一样，我看了看沸腾的群聊持续十几分钟的祝贺，开香槟和口令红包才认识到这是一场多么伟大的胜利，我对这几个月的付出完全不后悔。</p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233：经过7周的比赛，我们都非常的疲劳，就像一场梦一样，我们的努力得到了最完美的结局，感觉太棒了。</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: 我笑了，手机电脑全修好了，本来就患有燥动症的我……后面的忘了（笑。由于开赛前我状态不佳，我喝了一罐魔爪以保持状态，因此本就兴奋得睡不着觉的我加上能量饮料加持更是到了凌晨五点才睡觉，也导致第二天无精打采啥都干不了（笑。在资格赛成绩出来之前，我从未想过能在这样竞争激烈的国际比赛上取得名次，更不敢觊觎这样宝贵的主页缎带，但随着时间的推移，我越来越坚信，我，我们，配得上所有荣誉。当我们踏上4DM正赛旅程的一刻起，我们的目标就应该是最终的冠军。最终我们也抓住了这来之不易的机会成功圆梦，我们也可以宣布在这一赛事功成身退了（笑。</p>
<p>Molli：其实19年我就收到过4dm中国队的邀请，但是当时忙于学业再加上玩osu的重心主要偏向于std，并没有参加那次4dm，最后也只是当了一个旁观者。而这次4dm我们抓住了机会，积累了这么久的力量凝聚了起来，为中国4k历史书写上了浓厚的一笔，我相信这次的胜利只是开端，以后的中国4k会再创辉煌。</p>
<p>Zyuuu：起飞🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫🛫</p>
<p><strong>这次比赛之后，中国队的前景如何？我们是否会在今年的 4k Mania 世界杯上看到你们中的一些人与 [Crz] 选手联手？还是会继续推动你们自己在这个游戏中想要完成的目标？</strong></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu：今年的MWC4K2023中国队的选拔会和以往不同，而我也是测试者和参与者之一。不过嘛，学业更重要！高考完过后，我应该会花很多时间出去玩，回到osu!的时间应该不会很早，可能复键不起来，而且也有更多强势的选手们可以替换掉我，所以我就把机会让给其他玩家啦！我其实16个月前就过了Beta段，可是到现在都过不了Gamma段和Tachyon段，LN13段和xfpsb4段也是最近才踩线（Mafufu的极限是出了名的拉胯），以后我应该会努力去考Crz战队的，虽然两年前就已经开始幻想了。在此也希望MWC4K中国队也能创造历史！我还是很希望4DM2023中国队里能有玩家进入MWC4K的。不过可能有点困难？没事！总有一天都可以的！大家继续前进，把里程碑立在更远的地方！</p>
<p>lovely_hyahya：我们对明年的比赛也很有信心，中国有庞大的玩家群体，经过这次比赛已经有相当大的玩家群体表明了明年会参加4DM的意愿。个人来说我可能会暂时休息一会，我很享受这个游戏。作为player我达成了一个里程碑一样的目标；作为mapper，我也希望大家能够喜欢我的谱子，接下来的这几个月我会把目标放在ranked谱面上面，希望大家都能在ranked区见到我的名字！另外和[Crz]联手估计不太可能，因为目前来说[Crz]选手不可能是四位数的玩家（谁知道呢，说不是明年的四位数全都是tachyon delta人了呢？）</p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233：中国有着充足的下位比赛，有着诸多优秀人才储备，相信在未来其他的中国队员们会继续努力，取得好的成绩。至于MWC，Crz的成员们还是我们4DM队员目前无法匹敌的（除了大爹mafufu），和他们联手征战mwc短期来说不太现实，但希望将来有机会。</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: 如果你被超carryt的Mafufu在4DM的精彩表现圈粉，我相信你会非常想看到他作为中国队的一员在MWC2023续写传奇。敬请期待！对我个人而言，我或许还不够格参与MWC，但不得不说我得感谢国内的很多高手，像[Crz]Caicium、[Crz]Riko、[Crz]Flandre、Kuiiiiteeee和[GB]Rysun他们，在总决赛前他们陪着我们练习，帮助我们突破极限，这对我最终的发挥也起到了很重要的作用。我会继续练习写图、参加MCNC和在GBC干活。另外我非常期待未来的LN中国杯（或许也可能是华人杯？），看到国内赛事风生水起，我真的很开心。此外最重要的，我该努力毕业和考研了，因此下半年起没准我会退坑一段时间。</p>
<p>Molli：我还没有到mwc那种水平（笑），之后我可能也会当一名普通的mania enjoyer，直到哪里需要我吧。</p>
<p>Zyuuu：我只是一名普普通通的osumania玩家，不过还会成长，希望大家享受游戏，祝大家飞升！</p>
<p><strong>非常感谢中国接受采访。我爱中国，我爱冰淇淋，我也爱超级偶像。祝你在今后的工作中好运!</strong></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu：你爱中国，你爱冰淇淋，你也爱超级偶像，但是我爱你。（够了啊喂）我爱4DM，我爱osu! ！一个储存了我无尽美好回忆的地方，一个永远能在我痛苦时陪伴我的朋友，一个能治愈致郁的我的天使！最后，感谢一路相伴！See you next time!</p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233：也同时感谢主办方，比赛实在是太累乐，还是原神休闲，但是我现在的目标是做完高中沉重的作业以及考好试（）</p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: 我爱4DM，我爱我的队友们，我爱在这里结识的每一位新朋友，希望以后能在更多比赛里和你们再会！</p>
<p>Molli：你爱我，我爱你，蜜雪冰城甜蜜蜜。（一个奶茶店的广告，哈哈）</p>
