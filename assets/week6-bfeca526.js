<h3>Song workflow</h3>
<p>tl;dr - random bullsh*t go</p>
<p>At first, we tried to think of the main motif of the song. Long story short that, in the evening of 9th September 2022, I had the random idea of performing the voiceover to the Tiebreaker Copypasta</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974693953217638493/1076070687330009109/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974693953217638493/1076070687330009109/image.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974693953217638493/1076071341448503387/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974693953217638493/1076071341448503387/image.png"></p>
<p>And that was how everything was started.</p>
<p>Firstly, we planned the rough outline in the spreadsheet, including some references (mostly artists or songs, to be precise) and Tempo of the song. They mostly followed from the ideal BPM from 4dm4, but with more extra difficulty targeted. For example, the <strong>uncertainty</strong> part was planned to be inverse switched with technical so we targeted them to be around 210-220 BPM. But actually still provide charters some freedom to put their own interpretations in.</p>
<p>We were brainstorming, transferring parts to each other, as well as making the transitions from part to part. Until takehirotei finished his intermission part which jailbroke us into another realm.</p>
<p>The 2nd half was all our style and original (well you can say except breakcore part where the sine wave usage was inspired from sasakure.uk a bit). Surprisingly our approaches seemed to work well together thanks to the transitions. And the last climax (essence) was the idea from the 4dm2023 organization team to provide the part to showcase the new mappers like one in M1LLI0N PP (4dm3 Grand Finals Tiebreaker) which were called <strong>The True Essence</strong> and the last piano solo were provided to induce more emotions after the long ride.</p>
<p>Poly agreed to contribute to this by providing her voiceover as a response to the tiebreaker copypasta before <strong>The True Essence</strong> providing us the most energetic voice to hype us up for the final climax.</p>
<p>For the timespan, it took exactly 3 months for us to finish the final flow from tiebreaker copypasta speech, from 9th September to 9th December. To be honest it was a really fair timespan for the tiebreaker like this (it also depends on the mental state of each composer, setting the reasonable deadline is important for custom track commission, especially when it is a Tiebreaker Scale)</p>
<p>However, the analysis of this song were done after the song was finished. We didn’t think about any sophisticated music theory (just follow the flow) while producing the track.</p>
<h3>What did we provide for charters and testers</h3>
<p>For charters, we provided the full overview of the song, including the timing, parts division and .osz file. As well as the note that there is a rhythm or time signature complexity for said parts.</p>
<p>For the uncertainty part, we also provided the music sheet for the mappers in order for them to follow the snaps more easily.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1077449427918262343/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1077449427918262343/image.png"></p>
<p>As HowToPlayLN is also a player who knows the mappers’ preferences. The mappers got to select the parts they like first, like this sheet below:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1077450762638077992/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1077450762638077992/image.png"></p>
<p>Then I was in charge of distributing the parts for each mapper, such that they could chart the parts using their full capacity. However, these are just suggestions for them and there could be the parts exchanging between mappers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1077451463963455518/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1077451463963455518/image.png"></p>
<p>For the <strong>True Essence Collab</strong>, we decided to invite 8 mappers, some of them are aspiring mappers who had the interesting performance when it comes to charting, and some of them are the residents in our mappool team. And we also have <strong>BilliumMoto</strong> who composed the 4DM4 Tiebreaker, <strong>Cryochemistry</strong> as our guest charter! We like to motivate the new mappers into the tournament scenes though c:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1077452765703458926/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1077452765703458926/image.png"></p>
<p>For the <strong>True Essence Collab</strong>, we sent the file without revealing other parts, artist name and title through the Discord Direct Message. And let them map before merging into the main file.</p>
<p>To the guest mappers, thank you so much for participating the collab with us! And hope you all have fun with it!</p>
<p>For the testers part, yes, we are proud to announce that we provided the fake file for the testers! By fake file, we mean that the map and the song is the same as the real one, but the Artist, Title, Difficulty Name were all faked (and they’re quite funny because it was a throwback to 4 Digit MWC 2, overcomplexification). The reason we did this because we also didn’t want them to know about the crucial song information, and lore as well. However, we’ve got some nice feedback for the map throughout the testing process though! (I think)</p>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<h3>Initial Ideas (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p><strong>HowToPlayLN:</strong> As I mentioned in the first paragraph, the intro was started from me having a random idea of putting the tiebreaker speech into a track, introducing the motif of 1547 (which will be explained later) with some weird chord progression.</p>
<p>I will explain how this motif works and how we came up with the chord progression. This will go deep into a little music theory (which might be wrong) behind it.</p>
<h3>Motif (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>The motif 1547 (image below) is the main motif of the song, and the whole album. It is the combination of the sequence <em>perfect fifth -&gt; major second -&gt; perfect forth -&gt; major second</em>. The reason why this works well is it works as a <em>Quartal Harmony</em> which is the space between the notes are perfect forth apart. The motif can be rearranged into 5147 which is perfectly a sequence of perfect forth or if compared to chord progression, it’s 2-5-1-4. This motif can also (coincidentally) be found in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kivawu/starlight-remix">3R2 - Starlight (KIVA Remix)</a> at <strong>2:32</strong> and <strong>5:18</strong> too. (Well I’m not blaming myself for predicting this lol)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1075456184171118592/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1075456184171118592/image.png"></p>
<p>And not to mention, 1547 was the initial ideas for the design for the jacket of this song, which will be revealed more in the graphics side of the Behind The Scenes articles.</p>
<h3>Chord Progression (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>This weird space-y chord progression was actually I -&gt; IV -&gt; V in disguise. In key C#m, we decided to go with <strong>C#m7</strong> which is just the root chord, then <strong>AMaj9(13)</strong> which can be the alternative for <strong>F#m</strong> and gives more of the soft-release feelings to the song then suddently there comes the <strong>BMaj7</strong> which the Major 7th in this chord is a tritone of the E which is the basy key of C#m before going into tritone of the V chord which is <strong>DMaj7</strong> to maximize the tension, after that we go back to the root of <strong>C#m7</strong> again.</p>
<h3>Additional Instruments and Effects (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>For the intro, other than what HowToPlayLN has said, I have also added a Cello solo in the intro while the piano is playing, this can make the intro sound interesting without sounding repetitive while still using the same lick throughout the intro as it gives more variety to the listeners.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355116026609755/Screenshot_322.png" alt="Screenshot_322.png"></p>
<p>the melody that the cello plays</p>
<p>That’s not all, I have added some glitchy sounds in the background so that it won't feel too empty to listen to. (Huge shoutout to WangleLine for her Data Hammer sample pack, the pack contains many amazing glitchy sounds, which is also free to download!)
download it here: <a href="https://youtu.be/jEHmzQ2gidM">https://youtu.be/jEHmzQ2gidM</a></p>

<p>samples of the glitches used</p>
<p>As you can notice, I have also applied some sound-manipulating techniques here. For example, at the end of the TB copypasta intro, I slowly applied bitcrusher to the piano sounds to give it sound like it’s coming to an end of a phrase.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355116487970846/Screenshot_324.png" alt="Screenshot_324.png"></p>

<p>KHs Bitcrush is a very good bitcrusher plugin which I got for free last time during their promotion. For a free alternative, I highly recommend dblue Crusher. It’s free and it’s very useful for sound design.</p>
<h2>Build up (takehirotei)</h2>
<p>So for the buildup, we decided to go with a camellia-like buildup as the chords and motif used are just too suitable to do it in a camellia style. The layers used in the buildup contains strings spiccato, hardcore bass, sub bass, supersaws, choir stabs, and electric guitar. Originally I did not include the electric guitars because I feel like they might be unsuitable for the song. However, after finishing the buildup, I feel like there are some elements missing and it sounded kinda empty, so I proceeded to try adding the electric guitar just as a joke, but what I did not expect is it actually fits the mood and it fills in the empty space of the buildup.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355116899029002/Screenshot_326.png" alt="Screenshot_326.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, I have left 4 empty spaces during the buildup for various elements to fill in the space. This way, it gives the sense of “disconnection”, which can be mapped interestingly in rhythm games as it gives more variety to the mappers/charters to map/chart them.</p>
<p>Also shoutout to Frums for the amazing 8bit sample pack, which was used at the very end of the first buildup before the bpm changes, be sure to check it out if you’re interested on it.</p>
<p>download link: <a href="https://frums.gumroad.com/l/coldorwarmorboth?layout=profile">https://frums.gumroad.com/l/coldorwarmorboth?layout=profile</a></p>

<p>For the second buildup, we accelerates the bpm from 195 to 258 so that our first drop can start with 258bpm.</p>
<h2>Beginnings</h2>
<h3>Drum Variations (takehirotei)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355117343621190/Screenshot_328.png" alt="Screenshot_328.png"></p>
<p>Before the very first drop of the song starts, I made a 4 bar small “peaceful” intro so that it can smoothly transition to the fast drop. A glass scatter sample is also added at the end of the “intro” to give it a sense that something dangerous is coming.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355117624643654/Screenshot_329.png" alt="Screenshot_329.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, in the first hardcore drop, I added some top kicks at the 2nd half of the drop to make it sounds more intense.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355168128237659/Screenshot_330.png" alt="Screenshot_330.png"></p>
<p>As for the 2nd drop, I’ve used 4 different drum patterning.</p>
<ol>
<li>The normal dubstep drum pattern,</li>
<li>DnB drum pattern,</li>
<li>Amen break drum pattern, and</li>
<li>Double time of the normal dubstep drum pattern (aka hardcore drum pattern).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355168342155304/Screenshot_331.png" alt="Screenshot_331.png"></p>
<p>Besides the dubstep basses, HowToPlayLN has also provided the piano melodies for this part so that it won’t feel too empty (and also can increase the chart density since this is a grandfinals tiebreaker anyways).</p>
<h3>Arpeggio Melodies (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>This melody was inspired by the chords in the first verse, however, there were some twists, and adding arpeggios make the space more filled. The example at the first phrase of the part is</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974693953217638493/1076060083055775744/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974693953217638493/1076060083055775744/image.png"></p>
<p>We can see that there were the chords repeated 2 times before each arpeggio, these are the main melody as well as the chords for the verse, the chords from the right hand actually filled up and created more tension, it is also known as “polychords” when two or more chords are played at the same time. (Note: This is more of the “adding tension”, not exactly the polychords but I also did this somewhere else, for example LNCryption actually used some polychords in some transitions)</p>
<p>The example is the F#m7, which also had G#7sus4 on top which created the 11th and 13th for the chord in the way that it doesn’t clash each other. But at the same time it also gives the tension to the chords.</p>
<h2>Uncertainty</h2>
<h3>Build-up (takehirotei)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355168627380234/Screenshot_332.png" alt="Screenshot_332.png"></p>
<p>For the buildup, we decide to decelerate the bpm so that the xi-inspired drop can be at 214bpm.</p>
<p>Firstly, the piano is playing repeating 1547, and soon enough, the supersaw slowly blends into the melody to gives the xi vibes (since piano+supersaw is the essence of xi musics (no pun intended)).</p>
<p>When the bpm becomes 214bpm, you’ll notice a very familiar drum patterning here. Yep, you guessed it, its inspired by <strong>dichroma, ludiosia. by rN vs. [Shanom, ptar124 &amp; Zekai]</strong> (from EGTS 2022 RO16 TB), and <strong>King Atlantis by Aoi</strong> (Corsace Open 2022 GF TB).</p>
<p><strong>dichroma, ludiosia.</strong> - <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/pWZLa">https://on.soundcloud.com/pWZLa</a> (skip to 0:50)</p>
<p><strong>King Atlantis</strong> - <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/cDcSp">https://on.soundcloud.com/cDcSp</a> (skip to 0:23)</p>
<p>As usual, I have bitcrushed the amen breaks to give them a unique sound instead of just using the normal amen breaks.</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering how the amen breaks are chopped, it’s chopped by using a FL plugin called SliceX</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355169147461683/Screenshot_334.png" alt="Screenshot_334.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355168908378142/Screenshot_333.png" alt="Screenshot_333.png"></p>
<p>SliceX is a very powerful tool to slice samples, not limited to amen breaks. You could even chop vocals using SliceX to create vocal chops that you can found in many popular EDM (most notable example is USAO songs that contains vocal chops).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355169399132240/Screenshot_335.png" alt="Screenshot_335.png"></p>
<p>Besides that, I have also done some pitch automation to the chopped amen breaks so they can sound more distinct.</p>
<h3>xi-inspired and rhythm subdivisions (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>This part was mainly inspired by <strong>xi</strong>, the chord progression on this part is not really complex, and we introduced the rhythm 3-3-3-3-2-2 rhythm cooperate with 5-5-6 rhythm in 4/4 time signature (figure below)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1062235131408044052/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1062235131408044052/image.png"></p>
<p>We can see that for the right hand (the main melody) used the 3-3-3-3-2-2 subdivisions while the left hand used the 5-5-6 subdivisions (which summed up to 16 which is 4/4 time signature)</p>
<h3>Chords and Time Signature Transitions to breakcore (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>The <em>transition to breakcore</em> part. Which I decided to use 3x5/8 time signature (technically 15/8) for each chord and the dominant 2nd chord. The thought process behind this is to repeat the first 5 beats such that it is equivalent to 4/4 but not really. Then we proceed with key changing from C#m -&gt; Am using the following chords: F# -&gt; F#m/G -&gt; Am/Bb -&gt; E7(b9) -&gt; A. We noticed that the bass Bb -&gt; E is a <strong>tritone</strong> and E -&gt; A is the 5 -&gt; 1. Other than that the time signature used in the E7(b9) chord is 3/4 + 3/4 + 7/8 (which is equivalent to 19/8). By adding an extra beat to the last bar of the chord, it makes the transition to the root chord feels smoother.</p>
<h3>Call-and-Response Technique (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>For the breakcore part (hint: 7/4). I decided to use <em>call-and-response</em> technique for the main melody based on common 7/4 progression which is</p>
<pre><code>x-x-xx-x-x-xx-
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1062794817735770112/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1062794817735770112/image.png"></p>
<p>Notice the right hand at the first bar and left hand at the second bar. It is the <em>call-and-response</em> melody, as well as the third bar:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1062795307332677652/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1062795307332677652/image.png"></p>
<p>Notice the emphasized notes that it has the same rhythm as the first and second bar, before we twisted into 5-5-4 rhythm with E7(b9) chords</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1062795648027598898/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1062795648027598898/image.png"></p>
<p>After looping through this progressions with deterministic and chaotic drum patterns (which I will not go over with because that is a mess lol) we arrive at the break part of the song.</p>
<p>To add on, this section's main melody is using piano+supersaw, while the counter melody while “responding” to the main melody is using other instruments such as alternative leads, violins, guitars and etc. By using different sounds, it can show the call-and-response clearer to the listeners.</p>
<h3>Sidechaining Techniques (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>So if you have noticed, during the 7/4 time signature part, you can hear that the kicks and amen breaks are playing at the same time. So you might be asking, how is this even possible to create as the kicks and amen breaks will clash together when stacking them as different layer?</p>
<p>The answer is, the amen breaks are sidechained to the kick.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355169650770060/Screenshot_336.png" alt="Screenshot_336.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, I create the volume automation of the to the amen breaks so that when the kick hits, the amen break will stay silent, and slowly go back to its original volume. Of course this isn't enough, we still need to EQ the amen breaks to make sure the low ends does not clash as well.</p>
<p>This way it can prevent them from clashing into each other and make both elements sounds clearer while playing at the same time.</p>
<h3>Break (HowToPlayLN &amp; takehirotei)</h3>
<p>We decided to go back to 4/4 and change the chord progression to make it feels more relieved and ready to transition to the next part, the chord progression we used was FMaj9(#11) -&gt; G13 -&gt; F#m9 -&gt; Em11 -&gt; FMaj9(#11) -&gt; G13 -&gt; Am11 -&gt; G.</p>
<p>The F#m9 can be used as a substitution to the Am9 chord, and it makes the resolution feels more impactful and more emotional. As well as the choice of using #11 in FMaj9, is to add the tritone to gather the tension to the chord progressions.</p>
<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>After 3 minutes of non-stop battle, maybe it’s a good time to take a short break.</p>
<h3>Orchestration (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>For this part, we decided to go with an orchestra theme. And since it’s an orchestra, of course, we have to choose some instruments first before even writing the part.</p>
<p>So in this case, we have chosen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cello solo (main)</li>
<li>The string section (Violin 1, Violin 2, Viola, Cello, Double Bass)</li>
<li>Brass (playing the same melody)</li>
<li>Electric guitar (x1 lead, x1 chords)</li>
<li>Synths (x1 lead)</li>
<li>Harp</li>
<li>Orchestra percussions</li>
</ol>
<p>So with all the instruments chosen, we can start composing using them (with a few extra sound effects and stuff to spice things up)</p>
<h3>The beauty of strings ensemble (takehirotei)</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/zjNEuEf_XbQ">https://youtu.be/zjNEuEf_XbQ</a></p>
<p>The video above shows all the things that are involved in the strings ensemble section.</p>
<p>Here are the roles of each instrument for this song:</p>
<p>Cello Solo - Plays the main melody</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079358023459418182/Screenshot_342.png" alt="Screenshot_342.png"></p>
<p>Violin 1 - Playing an alternative melody that supports the cello solo, while also supporting violin 2 occasionally</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355169915019364/Screenshot_337.png" alt="Screenshot_337.png"></p>
<p>Violin 2 - Playing an alternative melody that supports the cello solo, while also supporting violin 1 occasionally</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355170204438558/Screenshot_338.png" alt="Screenshot_338.png"></p>
<p>Viola - Supporting both cello solo and violins by playing another countermelody</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355170489630770/Screenshot_339.png" alt="Screenshot_339.png"></p>
<p>Cello - Plays a much simpler melody on the lower end to support everything else</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079357816084648037/Screenshot_340.png" alt="Screenshot_340.png"></p>

<h3>Panning (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>To simulate a real orchestra, I used the technique of panning the instruments. This is very important because in real life, the instrument players are sitting in different positions, and it’s impossible for all of them to be in the same place at the same time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355210536853554/Screenshot_343.png" alt="Screenshot_343.png"></p>
<p>Pay attention to the yellow/red circle thing, those are panning from left to right.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355118178287626/IMG_20230217_165541.jpg" alt="IMG_20230217_165541.jpg"></p>
<p>So in this case, this is the illustration of how the instruments are positioned (I apologize for my very bad handwriting)</p>
<h2>Ascendance</h2>
<p>Alright, break time is over, time to get into battle again!!!</p>
<h3>Build-up (takehirotei)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355210742386778/Screenshot_344.png" alt="Screenshot_344.png"></p>
<p>As we are entering the battle again, we decided to accelerate the bpm again to build more tension. But that’s not all.  Not only the bpm is accelerating, but the key is changing upwards as well! Which we will be covering that in the next section. We have also changed the time signature to 3/4 once the bpm has reached 264, this is to prepare the listeners so that they are aware that there will be more time signature changes later on (which is the section in which the time signature changes each bar).</p>
<h3>Key changes by using Circle of Fifths Crash Course (takehirotei)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355210926919700/Screenshot_346.png" alt="Screenshot_346.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355117901451334/circle-of-fifths-full.png" alt="circle-of-fifths-full.png"></p>
<p>Image source: <a href="https://appliedguitartheory.com/lessons/circle-of-fifths/">https://appliedguitartheory.com/lessons/circle-of-fifths/</a> and <a href="https://www.musicnotes.com/now/tips/circle-of-fifths-guide/">https://www.musicnotes.com/now/tips/circle-of-fifths-guide/</a></p>
<p>Alright, it’s time for music theory lesson. So, what is circle of fifth? The circle of fifths is the relationship among the 12 tones of the chromatic scale, their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys. (source: <a href="https://www.musicnotes.com/now/tips/circle-of-fifths-guide/">https://www.musicnotes.com/now/tips/circle-of-fifths-guide/</a>)</p>
<p>So, in short, if the keys are close to each other, they transition more smoothly, if they are further, they will transition roughly (which sometimes isn’t a bad thing when you want to change the mood very differently). Let’s say if we are in C major, then when we transition to G major or E minor, we will get a smooth transition; and when we transition to F# major or Eb minor from C major, it will be a rough transition.</p>
<p>In this case, the buildup for this part starts from A minor, and transitions to C minor → D# minor → F# minor → F minor → G# minor</p>
<p>As we can see in the circle of fifths, A minor → C minor, C minor → D# minor, D# minor → F# minor are 3 step away from each other, while F# minor → F minor is 5 steps away, and hence this gives a very big mood change to the song. This mood change can really bring an impact to the song as it is starting another new section. Then after that, F minor → G# minor is 3 steps away, which brings us to the original step spacings.</p>
<p>Now, we have finished talking about the key changes by using circle of fifths, BUT, we are not done yet. Circle of fifths are not just for key changes, it can even be used in chord transitions or progressions.</p>
<h3>Chord progressions by using Circle of Fifths Crash Course (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>So, before we get into it, let’s list out all the chords used in this buildup shall we?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355211136639026/Screenshot_349.png" alt="Screenshot_349.png"></p>
<p>FMaj9 → Gadd11 → G#Maj9 → A#add11 → BMaj9 → A#m7/C# → DMaj9 → C#m7/E → Cm7/D# →</p>
<p>C#Maj7(#11) → D#add9 → EMaj7 → F#add9 → G#6(9)/F → C#Maj7(#11) → D#add9</p>
<p>Now, FMaj9 and Gadd11 are the VI and VII of A minor. And if you noticed, Fmaj and Gmaj are just one step between Amin. This makes the chords able to transition smoothly. Now, moving on to Gadd11 → G#Maj9, that's like 5 steps between each other. Although this might seems to be a bad thing since the transition might be rough, but, since its a key change, so a rough transition will gives the listener a refresh so that they know the key have changed. The same concept goes on, until C#m7/E → Cm7/D#. Now, this one is interesting, noticed how the sequence of previous chord transitions are following a pattern of moving 2 steps to clockwise → moving 5 steps anticlockwise? C#m7/E → Cm7/D# breaks the chain of that pattern, instead of going 5 steps anticlockwise, it goes 5 steps clockwise. By breaking the chain, it tells the listeners that a drastic change is approaching.</p>
<p>Moving on to the second half of the chords, Cm7/D# → C#Maj7(#11), so after transitioning to Cmin, we break the chain again and transition to C#maj, which is only 2 steps away. Then, from here, C#Maj7(#11) → D#add9 → EMaj7 → F#add9, we use back the original sequence 2 steps to clockwise → moving 5 steps anticlockwise again. Until G#6(9)/F → C#Maj7(#11) → D#add9, we again, break the chain by moving 2 steps clockwise → 1 step anticlockwise → 2 steps anticlockwise. Although these chords transition smoothly due to their short distance, but due to our previous uniform sequence of changes, this can become a drastic change as well by breaking the chain, which tells the listeners that something big is coming, which is the first drop for this section.</p>
<h3>First Drop (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>Nothing really special about this part, just a usual takehirotei 3/4 speedy hardcore section featuring electric guitar (again).</p>
<p>The only notable thing on this part is the key transition from G#m → Bm to indicate that a new drop is coming.</p>
<h3>Second Drop: Time Signature Crash Course (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>Of course that you hear the time signature changes in this certain part, which are the followings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">7/8 -&gt; 4/4 -&gt; 5/4 -&gt; 9/8 -&gt; 7/8 -&gt; 15/16 -&gt; 7/8 -&gt; 13/16 -&gt; 7/8 -&gt; 4/4 -&gt; 5/8 -&gt; 17/16 -&gt; 5/4 -&gt; 9/8 -&gt; 4/4 -&gt; 7/8
</code></pre>
<p>This time signature progression were inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd48P-6SUgU">Kirby Super Star’s Marx Theme</a>. The idea is to balance between short time interval and long time interval.</p>
<p>To visualize, let’s sum each time signature pairs from the breakcore part up:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">15/8 -&gt; 19/8 -&gt; 29/16 (14.5/8) -&gt; 27/16 (13.5/8) -&gt; 15/8 -&gt; 27/16 (13.5/8) -&gt; 19/8 -&gt; 15/8
</code></pre>
<p>Due to its high bpm, the only significance difference could be found in 15/8 and 19/8 (2 beats apart), which can be fixed by the contrast of using short time signatures like 29/16 and 27/16.</p>
<p>To use this, we need to set the base time signature, which this case is 7/8, then we truncate or extend the time signatures in order to create the time signature changes, other than that, we need to keep the balance between the short time signatures and the long time signatures as well.</p>
<p>To create these time signature changes, another important factor is the melody, as the first phrase of each time signature pair is the mostly the same. Which created the smooth flow between the time signatures.</p>
<p>This tip however could be found in many tracks, the easy example would be the track which this track is inspired (Marx Theme), the base time signature is 6/8. Then there are fluctuations between the time signatures, for example 7/8, 5/8 or even 9/8.</p>
<p>This can also be found in <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16W4y1p7xq/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0">Unsynchronized Rhythms</a> from <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1633030?n=1">osu!mania LN Tournament 3</a>. For example, the intro of this song consists of the following sequences:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">4/4 -&gt; 7/8 -&gt; 4/4 -&gt; 15/16 -&gt; 4/4 -&gt; 7/8 -&gt; 4/4 -&gt; 13/16 -&gt; 4/4 -&gt; 7/8 -&gt; 4/4 -&gt; 15/16 -&gt; 4/4 -&gt; 7/8 -&gt; 5/8 (x2) -&gt; 11/16 -&gt; 4/4 -&gt; 3/8 (x3 ?) -&gt; 3/4
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that 7/8 and 15/16 are relatively close to 4/4, as well as 13/16 which is the trancation of 4/4 by 0.75 beat. We can see that the time signatures are relatively close to each other. As well as having the repeating motif of the chords in the song. Hence we can have the smooth flow throughout the intro.</p>
<p>All respect to the composer of Marx’s Theme and Supa7onyz for interpreting this technique and introduce the irregular time signature changes throughout the Video Games/Electronic tracks and inspired us to try to reverse engineer the technique and provide our own interpretations.</p>
<h3>Second Drop: Sidechaining Technique (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>As you have noticed, there is a breakcore and drums playing together, but this time, instead of amen break, HowToPlayLN have made a sequence of breakcore drums by using a kickdrum, and placing them in complex rhythms over the pitches</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355211358949376/Screenshot_351.png" alt="Screenshot_351.png"></p>
<p>the diagram above shows the sequence of the kickdrums.</p>
<p>And again, sidechaining technique is used again to ensure both the kickdrums and the breakcore drums do not clash with each other while playing both of them at the same time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355211631562752/Screenshot_352.png" alt="Screenshot_352.png"></p>
<h3>Speedcore: Time Signature Alternation (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>In this speedcore part, I decided to do the continuation from the breakcore part using the alternation between 5/4 and 9/8 time signature, which is the continuation from the last time signature 7/8.</p>
<p>We have seen quite a few transition between 7/8 4/4 and 5/4 9/8 pair on the last section, but for this, we also increased the BPM by a bit, and continue doing the time signature changes to make it consistent with the previous part, as well as the speedcore drums pattern provided by takehirotei.</p>
<p>For the melody, let’s take this as an example</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1076849219371008110/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1076849219371008110/image.png"></p>
<p>We can see that the 5/4 bar, we used the similar rhythmic pattern to some popular 5/4 songs like Mission Impossible Theme</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBZ6GPCJcxM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBZ6GPCJcxM</a></p>
<p>However, for the 9/8 line, we decided to cut the half beat down, the last three quavers of the bar will pass the melody to the next bar. This will also make it smoother between the breakcore and the next drop (the true essence buildup), and make it more easy to follow along despite being the irregular time signature.</p>
<h3>Speedcore: Bassline (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>So, I have decided to do a funny on this part’s bassline. Let's see if you can find them or not. (there are 3 funny licks that have been used here)</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pEt-7uzQAcs">https://youtu.be/pEt-7uzQAcs</a></p>
<p>Answers are in the comment section</p>
<h2>Essence</h2>
<h3>Revised Tiebreaker Copypasta (Polytetral)</h3>
<p>To answer why I decided to create a response to the tiebreaker copypasta, there is something you should know, and it is that I first came up with this. The quote came to be, partially because I was obsessed with overperforming on a tiebreaker in 4DM2. Those who existed back then can probably recall that Singapore went head to head against France in Loser's Semi-finals, and was a match I remembered with vivid detail, precisely because both teams went through serious up and downs, <strong>even the infamous 24-point score difference</strong>, just to end up at the tiebreaker situation.</p>
<p>I can definitely say that the tiebreaker situation makes rivals admire each other, creates the blue flames that melts every nerve into emotion, and allows some players to perform much better than they think they could. Even though seldom played, it is typically the climax of every match and tournament, and deserves posterity and appreciation.</p>
<p>With that context, most of the response was simply made up in a way to commemorate the birth of the tiebreaker culture in tournaments where teams forget they’re at heads against each other, are simply happy with just having fun playing the game, making that match a game they were predestined to never forget every tide and turn of. It also turned out to be the vocal partaking in the final buildup, which I happened to voice as well. It's embarassing but I'm incredibly happy to be able to do this in the end!</p>
<h3>Arp303 Buildup (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>This sound can be heard during the voiceover</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/c5_Jna5RmlE">https://youtu.be/c5_Jna5RmlE</a></p>
<p>Which is actually Sylenth1 default preset when it first opens. It somehow became a meme due to how different it is from other synthesizers (which most of the synthesizers starts with a saw wave or something similar)</p>
<p>Composerily actually did a meme based on this sound, but very unfortunately, he deleted his channel, and hence the video is lost forever :sobs:</p>
<p>And it surprisingly works well as an acid loop here to fill in the empty spaces, hence we decided to keep it lol</p>
<h3>Bassline buildup (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>Noticed how the bass is now playing the melody from Ascendance (breakcore) part?</p>
<p>By playing the melody on bass, we can transition smoothly to another melody without feeling “disconnected”. This is a great technique to use if you’re planning to make a long song and want them to transition smoothly.</p>
<h3>”This is the true essence” vocal sound design (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>To give the pre-drop vocal more impact, some sound design is performed to the vocal. For this case, I have vocoded the voice with the relative chord to give it more impact.</p>
<h3>12-tone Usage (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>There is a little melody played in the background before <strong>“This is the True Essence”</strong> vocal, which (kind of) resonates the essence constellation in the storyboard. So, this is the melody played.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1076855413246533693/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1076855413246533693/image.png"></p>
<p>This is the popular technique in Atonal Music Composition, namely, 12-tone row. The idea is to distribute the notes such that there is no note is emphasizing the individual key, which is to use all of the 12 tones possible. This also gives the interesting sounds which can represent the shine (and the “essence”) of the stars in the sky.</p>
<h3>Genre Changes every 8 bars (takehirotei)</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355206086709339/Screenshot_365.png" alt="Screenshot_365.png"></p>
<p>For the genre decision,  we basically just choose the genres that are suitable in high bpm, so in this case, we choose hardcore, chiptune, xi (yes, xi is a genre), artcore, metal, frenchcore and speedcore. As for deciding their placement, we need to find genres that can be transition smoothly to each other. Hence, hardcore was used as the first genre since it can literally transition into anything, then follow by chiptune and xi. xi and artcore have some similarity, hence we can put artcore after xi. As metal can again, transition into anything due to its wide use, we put it between artcore and hardcore. After that, frenchcore, speedcore and hardcore is pretty similar, so we just put them back to back.</p>
<h3>BPM Changes every 4 bars (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>The BPM changes in this part are applied every 4 bars, and they are all, <strong>Prime Numbers</strong> from 223 to 317.</p>
<h3>Totally Random Notes (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>In the transition from 251bpm to 257bpm, there are the triplets played, which is this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1076857209117474887/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1076857209117474887/image.png"></p>
<p>This is totally random, and there is no further explanation (maybe similar to 12-tone and the chord actually addresses it? idk)</p>
<h3>onostrapha reference (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>The same part, before transitioning to metal, this is the melody played</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1076857957083512852/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1076857957083512852/image.png"></p>
<p>This is a homage to <strong>rN - onostrapha,</strong> the osu! world cup 2022 custom song. rN used the quintuplet, following with septuplet in the piano intro before the trills. This also gives the “twist” and preparation for the next part.</p>
<h2>Forever</h2>
<h3>The Lost Dedication to Cryochemistry (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>In the last piano arrangement, I cited <strong>The Lost Dedicated</strong> and <strong>Cryochemistry</strong> into the arrangement. Especially Cryochemistry, this song was really my inspiration into making a tiebreaker music, as well as inspired me a lot in storyboarding, and providing me the huge motivation to push this community forward.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t get to this point where we did the entire lore, an album and the fully innovative storyboard for Essence without this song. And I would like to thank you so much for the opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>I LOVE YOU BILLIUMMOTO AND AKIRI</strong></p>
<h3>Microtonal (takehirotei)</h3>
<p>Alright, remember how I said we can transition the keys by using the circle of fifths? What if I told you there’s another method to transition the keys</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1079355211841282098/Screenshot_353.png" alt="Screenshot_353.png"></p>
<p>So before I start explaining, Essence starts with C# minor, and at the current point (after the true essence part), it’s D minor. I want to transition back to C# minor, but it would require me 5 steps clockwise from the circle of fifth. This is pretty hard to do as I wanted to maintain the mood of composition, so I’m unable to do that much key transitions. But then, I remembered, instead of transitioning with 12 tone system, I can transition it with microtonal, which is more than 12 tone. So, what if, I automate the channel pitch of the piano, and transition back to C#? I decided to try it and it works perfectly. The key have changed back to C# minor without ruining the overall mood of the composition.</p>
<p>As an analogy, noticed how a riser.wav is rising without sounding weird? For these cases, we are making the 12 tone system into near infinite tone system, which gives a smooth transition between keys without having it sounding weird.</p>
<h2>Extras</h2>
<ul>
<li>1547 have been played a total of 166 times throughout the entire song!</li>
<li>Do not look at the song length, you will regret it.</li>
<li>There is a total of 89 red lines on the osu map! This means there’s a total of, or more than 89 times where the bpm or time signature changes!</li>
</ul>
