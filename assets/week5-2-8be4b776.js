<p><strong>Congratulations on your victory vs Brazil! Can I get your thoughts on your victory against Brazil?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>祝贺你们在对阵巴西的比赛中取得胜利。我可以听听你们对巴西的胜利的看法吗？</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>[GB]mmttyy233</strong>：It was a tough win, and each of us did our best.</p>
<p><em>这是一场非常艰难的胜利，所有人都拼尽了自己的全力。</em></p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: It is REALLY a hard journey, from the preparations to the match-play. Brazil is absolutely a STRONGGGGGGG team, we almost did our best, but just took it hard with 6:4, it's also a valuable experience for our team.</p>
<p><em>从赛前的准备，到整个比赛过程，可以说不可谓不艰难。巴西是非常强大的的对手，我们发挥出了我们几乎最佳的状态才做到6：4险胜，对我们自己来说也是很难得的一次宝贵经历。</em></p>
<p>Molli: My teammates are too strong so I only played the sv, and just participated as a cheerleader xD. It almost made our hearts jump out of our chests when the issue during 3:2 happened, but we finally won that point on our own, it's crucial.</p>
<p><em>我的队友太给力了以至于我只上了一次sv，所以我一直在场下为他们加油(啦啦队式队员实锤x)，中间3：2时那次事故简直快让大家的心脏都跳出来了，但最后还是靠大家的实力赢下了那关键的一分，这是至关重要的。</em></p>
<p>lovely_hyahya：(&gt;д&lt;;) It's not easy. Brazil's overall acc is much higher than ours, and we are ready to play TB before. As an alpha dan player, it is not easy to compete with a team much stronger than me and win.</p>
<p><em>(&gt;д&lt;;) 非常不容易，巴西的整体acc比我们要高不少，我们在这之前已经做好了打TB的准备。作为一个alpha人，和比自己实力高不少的队伍比赛并且赢了来说，很不容易。</em></p>
<p>Zyuuu：With the difficulty of the mappool increase, we found it harder to keep stable competing with Brazil. They have stifling accuracy and dominance in most of the Rice maps. It is definitely a hard match. My heart was about to EXPLODE both playing and watching.</p>
<p><em>随着图池难度的提升，我们更难的去保持稳定性与巴西抗衡，在大多数常规图中巴西有着令人窒息的准度和统治力。可谓是一场相当艰难的比赛。无论是在场上打还是在场下当观众，我的心跳蹦蹦蹦蹦蹦蹦蹦蹦。</em></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu: Well, as the captain, I was entirely surprised by the legendary performance of Brazil. After a series of discussions, we took this match more seriously than ever before. For that current situation, I issued an emergency notice to the Chinese team in advance and prepared for the worst result. As expected, unity and trust are the key to victory, You can always believe in Team China!</p>
<p><em>好吧，作为队长，赛前我对巴西队超神的发挥完全震撼到。经过一系列思考讨论过后，我们对这一场比赛的重视程度史无前例的高，以至于对于现状，我提前对中国队发表了紧急事态的通知，做好了最坏的打算。不过果然团结与信任才是获胜的王道。你可以永远相信中国队！</em></p>
<p><strong>This is a very interesting Chinese team filled with new players that are competing for the first time since 2021. What makes you guys stand out from the other Chinese 4DMWC teams?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>这是一支非常有趣的中国队，充满了新的选手，这是自2021年以来第一次参加比赛。是什么让你们从其他中国4DMWC队伍中脱颖而出？</strong></em></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu: First of all, I would definitely like to pay my sincere gratitude to [GB]yobrevelc for his hard work on the Chinese osu!mania 4K community and his great contribution to our 4DM2023 team. Each player has been selected and polished through layers of testing to finally make up such a 4DM2023 team. As a former MWC specialty player, I was also involved in the selection process. I admire every player who participated in the tryout and I have great trust in my teammates. It was also an honor for me to make up such a united and friendly team.</p>
<p><em>首先，我一定要在此感谢[GB]yobrevelc对中国osu!mania 4K社区的辛勤付出，他也为我们4DM2023的队伍做出了巨大的贡献。每一位选手都经过层层考验筛选和打磨，最终才组成了这样一支4DM2023队伍。作为前MWC特长选手，我也参与到了选拔中。我对每一位参与考验的玩家都感到敬佩，我也十分相信我的队友们。能够组成这样一个团结友爱的队伍也是我的荣幸。</em></p>
<p>[GB]lovely_nyanya：( • ̀ω•́ )✧ In fact, we didn't receive any advertisements about 4DM before 2021, so few people signed up. there have been many mania tournaments in China before 4DM, such as GBcup organized by GB team, and the players are almost near four digits. Mappools are also very similar to the 4DM's (overall, GBC's is easier), so we can say that we are fully prepared for this kind of tournament. Personally, I have participated in GBC(3 times), RDC (Roast Duck Cup), New Year's Cup, and mcnc7k (China 7k Cup) in turn before I participated in 4DM, and other teammates have also participated in many tournaments.</p>
<p><em>( • ̀ω•́ )✧其实主要还是2021年之前我们并没收到关于4DM的任何宣传，所以很少有人报名。实际上我们国内在这之前就有很多mania比赛了，例如由GB team举办的GBcup，参赛选手也几乎都是四位数左右的水平，图池和4DM也很相似（整体简单上一点），可以说我们对这种类似的比赛还是做好了充足的准备的。就我个人而言，参加4DM之前就已经依次参加了三次GBC，RDC（烤鸭杯），元旦杯和mcnc7k（中国7k杯），其他队友也分别参加了不少比赛，在这里我就不详举了。</em></p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233: All of us are experienced and skilled players in domestic tournaments, so we can perform well in the tryout and each match. Love Luoxuan, believe in Luoxuan, waiting for Luoxuan, baby I love you.</p>
<p><em>我们队伍中都是有参加国内赛事的经验的选手，并且都有着足够的实力，因此可以在tryout以及比赛中发挥出好的状态。爱落轩，信落轩，等落轩，落宝爱你。</em></p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327：Holy s**t I love you toooooooooooooooooooooo</p>
<p><em>神圣的座位 我也爱你啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊</em></p>
<p>Molli: (˃ ⌑ ˂ഃ )In another international mania tournament, my teammates invited me to participate in 4DM, thus I knew the tournament and strived to join Team China. Besides, I'd played many domestic tournaments and accumulated experience, which let my teammates know me and my skill. As a player who only act in std tournaments before, I'll express my gratitude to my teammates, thank your appreciation.</p>
<p><em>(˃ ⌑ ˂ഃ )在另一场国际mania比赛中，我的队友劝我打4dm比赛，借此了解了4dm并为加入中国队而努力。在此之前国内的大型mania比赛我也会去参加，因此积累了很多参赛经验，也让我的队员认识了我，知道了我擅长的技能，让我一个只在std圈子活跃的人能够加入到此次4dm中国队，非常感谢队友们的赏识。</em></p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: As other teammates said, all of us have adequate tournament experience, maybe it makes us have a better mentality and perform better than other stronger teams. Besides, to answer it shamelessly, as the mappool selector and one of the managers of the tryout, I feel really accomplished(￣m￣）</p>
<p><em>正如其他人所说，我们的全体队员都有充足的比赛经验，这让我们在心态和状态上有时可能会领先于纸面实力强于我们的队伍。此外，厚脸皮地说，作为国内tryout的组织者之一和图池选取者，我感到非常有成就感(￣m￣）。</em></p>

<p><strong>China will be advancing to the Winner's Finals for the first time ever in the country's history in 4DMWC. China has finished in 4th place in 4DMWC 2019 &amp; 2021. So this is the first time ever you guys will finish in Top 3. How do you guys feel knowing that you are making history not for yourselves, but for your country as well?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>中国将在4DMWC的历史上首次晋级优胜者决赛。中国在2019年和2020年的4DMWC中获得了第四名。因此，这是你们有史以来第一次进入前三名。知道你们不只是为自己，而是为国家创造历史，你们有什么感受？</strong></em></p>
<p>lovely_hyahya：(๑ \`▽´๑)۶ Not only will we make history this year, but there are also many other strong seed players in our tryout who have not participated in 4DM this year. I believe we will continue to write this history next year!</p>
<p><em>（๑ \`▽´๑)۶ 我们不仅是今年会创造历史，在我们tryout内还有很多其他的强力种子选手今年没有参加4DM，相信明年我们也会继续续写这段历史！</em></p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233：I was really surprised. We speculated many dream teams set by other countries, tbh the result is beyond my expectation. We will meet stronger teams in the Finals and Grand Finals, which will be an experience I will NEVER forget.</p>
<p><em>我感到非常惊喜，在赛前我们有猜测过很多艘银河战舰，这个成绩是我意想不到的，在finals和grandfinals中我们要面对更强大的对手，这会是我永生难忘的经历。</em></p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: I'm proud of myself and our team, and I feel more and more confident during the whole tournament. Although our opponents are strong too, I believe we will never stop here.</p>
<p><em>我为自己和队伍感骄傲，在整个赛程中我对自己也越来越有自信，我相信我们绝不会止步于此，尽管对手很强。</em></p>
<p>Molli: This is probably the biggest achievement in my mania career. I'm really excited.</p>
<p><em>这可能是我mania生涯中最耀眼的成就，我很激动。</em></p>
<p>Zyuuu：I've never had a better achievement lets goooooooooooooooo</p>
<p><em>从未如此美妙的开局 lets goooooooooooooooo</em></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu: Progress is the goal, and ideal is the standard. ——Victor Hugo. Without a doubt, we won't stop here, we will move on.</p>
<p><em>进步是目的，理想是标准。——雨果。毫无疑问，这不会是我们的终点，我们会继续向前。</em></p>
<p><strong>You guys will be facing off against Singapore in the Winner's finals. What is China's strategy going into this match against Singapore?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>你们将在优胜者决赛中与新加坡队对决。中国在与新加坡的比赛中采取什么策略？</strong></em></p>
<p>[GB]Mafufu: Good question. It's a really good question. What a good question it is. Just guess our strategy, and just guess whether I will guess whether you will guess our strategy or not. First of all, I have to spend 90 hours of class, 42 hours of sleep, 30 hours of homework, and 2 hours of travel from school to home, and from home to school in senior three, Then I could just spend the remaining 4 hours of PC time. After that, I need to spend time downloading the mappool and coming up with tactics. Finally is the mappool-practicing. So the strategy is: Mafufu's time planning, a.k.a. Mafufu's Timinghell. I'm SERIOUS, TRULY.</p>
<p><em>好问题。这真是个好问题。多么好的问题啊。你猜我们用什么战略，你再猜我猜不猜你猜不猜我们的战略。首先我要在学校度过高三每周168小时里90小时的课，42小时的睡眠，30小时的作业时间，2小时的上学放学路程，才能度过剩下4个小时拥有PC的时间，其中我要花时间下载图池研究战略再才是练习。所以，策略是：Mafufu的时间攻略。我认真的，真的。</em></p>
<p>lovely_hyahya：Luckily, I am a college student and I don't have to do homework and I have very few classes, so I can lovelove with my cute waifus until 15 am then get up every day, ahahahahahahah amogus</p>
<p><em>还好我是大学生不用写作业，课程也很少，每天可以一直和我的老公老婆们唧唧我我直到早上十五点(?)才起床，啊哈哈哈哈哈哈嗝</em></p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: How can we ******* win (wry), for me, I will try my best to keep my combo (not fc in most situations), and let my BIG DADDY like Mafu↑fu↑, lovely hya↑hya↑, maomaotaotouyinyou233, molimolimolimolimolimolimolimolimo and yuuuuuuuuuuu carry me is ok xD</p>
<p><em>这特么怎么打得过（苦笑），对我个人而言的话，尽可能地保住combo（大概率不是fc），然后等我的五位大爹们带我飞就好了(。</em></p>
<p>lovely_hyahya: ( • ̀▽•́ ) Let me play eroge for a while these days, waiting for my teammate to carry me. By the way, I really love the commentator steeeven brings me lots of fun when spelling the username of CN players, I hope I can meet such an interesting commentator in the next match again.</p>
<p><em>( • ̀▽•́ ) 让我这几天先玩一会小黄油，等我的队友carry我。顺带一提，我真的很喜欢之前的解说steeeven，在读出我们队员用户名的时候感觉非常有趣，希望接下来的比赛还能遇到这样有趣的解说。</em></p>
<p>[GB]mmttyy233：The best strategy is no strategy. Singapore is a STRONG team, any tricks will not play a role in facing such a DREAM TEAM. (means I will start goblin mod)</p>
<p><em>最好的策略就是没有策略。新加坡是一支极其强大的队伍，策略在面对这支银河战舰的时候毫无作用。（人话：开摆））</em></p>
<p>Molli：(ゝω・´★)Two of my teammates in another mania game are 4DM players in Singapore, maybe I could act cute to let them throw the game.</p>
<p><em>(ゝω・´★)我的另一场mania比赛的队友有两个是新加坡4dm队员，或许我可以卖萌让他们放放水之类的。</em></p>
<p>lovely_hyahya：(ノ￣д￣)ノMolli chan so kawaii, AWSL, oh god I'm dead.</p>
<p><em>(ノ￣д￣)ノ茉莉酱好可爱啊，啊我死了。</em></p>
<p>Zyuuu: The strategy is to do my level best! Although we may not be as strong as Singapore.</p>
<p><em>策略是全力以赴！尽管我们实力或许不及于新加坡。</em></p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: No, I believe our STRONG YUUUUUUUU will lead us to victoryyyyyyy!</p>
<p><em>错误的，大鱼老师会出手！</em></p>
<p><strong>One more question: Ice Cream or Fast &amp; Furious 9?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>还有一个问题。冰淇淋还是《速度与激情9》？</strong></em></p>
<p>lovely_hyahya：(´＞ᴗ･\`) Super Idol de xiao rong, dou mei ni de tian, ba yue zheng wu de yang guang, dou mei ni yao yan, re ai yi bai ling wu du de ni, di di qing chun de zheng liu shui~</p>

Distilled water that is pure every drop</p>
<p>Molli：If you want me to say something, I'll say something. Also thought about it, what to say a few words, then I say these words. Well, I believe, these are better than those, too. So that's what I'm gonna say today. So if you don't think this is comprehensive enough, please give me a few more in the future. Here's my summary: three points. What about the first point? The first point, as we say, is the second point. This second point ah, we said after listening to let everyone feel, is not, ask, this, of course, should say today the most weight ah is the third point, so this third point, what is it? We talked about the third right, and we showed that it was right, so I made it very clear. I believe it. I think you know it.</p>
<p><em>既然让我说几句呢，那我就说几句啊。也是想了想啊，说哪几句呢，那我就说这几句。那么我相信啊，这几句呢，嗯也是比那几句强。所以我今天呢，就先说这几句。那么如果大家觉得啊说这几句不够全面啊，将来呢再给我补充几句。我总结呢，就是三点。这第一点呢，第一点啊，按咱们说最重要的是第二点。这第二点呀，我们说听完了以后让大家感觉，是不是，问，这，当然了，应该说今天最有重量的啊是第三点，那么这第三点，它是什么呢。我们讲第三对不对，又表明了对不对，那么刚才呢，我已经讲的非常明白。我相信啊，大家呢也应该很明白。</em></p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: Molli is at least a department-level cadre refer to his answer.</p>
<p><em>你这发言高低得是个厅级干部</em></p>

<p>[GB]Mafufu: You're right, but OSU! is a rhythm game developed by ppy, which is well known for its various modes, you can choose 4 modes such as standard, taiko, catch, and mania. You'll act as a player, practicing hard and farming pp hard, meeting players with different personalities and unique abilities in the mp room and progressing with them --meanwhile, gradually discover the truth of Top.</p>
<p><em>你说的对，但是《OSU!》是由ppy开发的一款音乐节奏类游戏。其以模式多样而著称，您可以选择std、taiko、catch、mania四个模式。你将扮演一位玩家，在各种模式中努力练习、冲击排名，在mp房间里邂逅性格各异、能力独特的玩家们，和他们一起进步--同时，逐步发掘「Top」的真相。</em></p>
<p>[GB]Luoxuan0327: Damn why my teammates are just crazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy facing this question(, I choose the ice cream, cuz I have even never watched the Fast&amp;Furious, just listened See you Again (maybe it's unbelievable lol).

<h2>Hong Kong</h2>
<p><strong>I’m here with the Hong Kong 4DMWC 2023 team! How are you guys doing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DC2_727</strong>: I’m good</p>
<p><strong>Pofnkul</strong>: Doing alright.</p>
<p><strong>[Mom] xbob</strong>: I'm doing good</p>
<p><strong>Roy2206</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>So congratulations on advancing to the Finals week! You guys start off your Semi-Finals week against the United Kingdom and won 6-4, and then you guys swept against the United States! I want to know what was the strategy coming into Semi-Finals week against the United Kingdom &amp; the United States.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DC2_727</strong>: Nothing much. Because the nerves always get me every round in match. you know, just play the game and hit all the notes as much as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Roy2206</strong>: I advised my team to focus on ln and hb when facing UK, and then we focused on rice when facing US. Also trying our best to practice sv properly.</p>
<p><strong>Pofnkul</strong>: Against United States, we mainly focused on taking advantage of their low acc on rice maps. A lot of the time we could out score an fc with a high acc run even if we didn't fc.</p>
<p><strong>[Mom] xbob</strong>: Before the UK match happened we actually noticed that they are quite decent in LNs, so we decided to go for rice picks and some SVs and that actually worked out for us. Then when the US match happened, we also had a similar analyzation strategy by checking their previous performance in semis round 1.</p>
<p><strong>So this is the first time ever in 4DMWC that Hong Kong will be advancing into the Finals Week for the first time. As a team of 6 players who are making history for their country, how do you guys feel about advancing into the Finals Week, + getting a Top 6 finish no matter what?</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mom] xbob</strong>: I'm actually satisfied with how our country has been performing this year, considering the fact that the last 2 years in 4dm we never reached on a stage this far and I'm really honored to be a part of this team. To reach the finals stage is already beyond our expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Pofnkul</strong>: It honestly feels crazy. I didn't expect to even make it into the team so im very happy with how things turned out. Although I don't really know too much about how this team did in the past since im relatively new.</p>
<p><strong>DC2_727</strong>: We actually didnt expect we have come to this far from 4dm2023, last year is actually quite a tragedy. But in this year, fortunately we managed to get back some former players from 4dm3 which is miso and holysteven. These guys are always the mvp of the team.</p>
<p><strong>Roy2206</strong>: It's a miracle to gather a group of skillful people in hk to perform this well compared to last year. I'm also glad to contribute in this team. But of course it is better to aim higher for better results in 4dm2023.</p>
<p><strong>So obviously, you guys want to make it into Top 3, and maybe take it all, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Roy2206</strong>: ofc! But it’s not a must. I mean, the attitude is important.</p>
<p><strong>Pofnkul</strong>: Top 3 would be great but it feels highly unlikely. No reason not to try though!</p>
<p><strong>DC2_727</strong>: We will do our best. Self-confidence is the most important.</p>
<p><strong>[Mom] xbob</strong>: Our current aim is to try our best and perform as good as we can in finals, and of course if we manage to get into the podiums I couldn't be any more happier</p>
<p><strong>So you guys are going up against Brazil in the Loser's Finals, and then whoever is in the Conditional Loser's Finals match (Malaysia/Canada) for the 3rd place spot. Any thoughts on your future opponents?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DC2_727</strong>: Team Brazil is going to be a tough one because their rice and LN skillsets are incredible. Such as Maykee kee and Buvuw. Let's hope the Finals mappool would favour us.</p>
<p><strong>Pofnkul</strong>: Brazil will be a tough opponent. I feel like our scores are pretty evenly matched and there's a chance that the difficulty of the next pool may affect how the matchup goes. As for our conditional opponent my only real comment is that i don't want to have to matchup against Canada again. I'd rather not have the potential to lose to the same team twice.</p>
<p><strong>Roy2206</strong>: It is definitely going to be tough. Most of us are struggling to play semifinals mappool well. It's hard to imagine how hard the finals mappool. However no matter what we will try our best to play against them seriously. They are all very expert players anyways, assuming all of us can make this far.</p>
<p><strong>[Mom] xbob</strong>: Team Brazil is actually a quite powerful force as far as I know by watching their previous performances, all I can say is may the best country win and if we manage to go to the conditional loser's finals match, we hope to perform as good as possible considering the fact that the other 4 countries are also insanely good in some aspects.</p>
<p><strong>One more question: has the Hong Kong osu!mania community is aware of your guys' amazing performance in this year's 4DMWC? If so, how do they feel about you guys advancing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pofnkul</strong>: I don't know anything about the rest of the community but I am happy that I've had the chance to meet all these new people.</p>
<p><strong>[Mom] xbob</strong>: Yes, as a matter of fact many of them usually watch us perform in 4DM as well, I'm sure that they are quite proud of how far we have came in this edition of 4DM and we hope to deliver more as we advance in the finals</p>
<p><strong>DC2_727</strong>: Yes, the community always cheer for us. It feels great when there are actually have some people supporting us.</p>
<p><strong>Roy2206</strong>: They set up the tryout. We're very glad to have their support. Other than 6 of us they also helped us a lot at analyzing teams. They are really proud of us making this far.</p>
<p><strong>Well regardless, no matter what's the outcome, Hong Kong is very proud of you guys for performing very well! And regardless of the result, I'm sure this country is very proud of you all :D . Best of luck to you all on Finals week!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hong Kong</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<hr>
<h2>United States</h2>
<p><strong>How are you guys doing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>_Seth</strong>: Just chillin.</p>
<p><strong>Znow</strong>: 50/50, I’m not feeling the best after that match</p>
<p><strong>Retina</strong>: Still stings about that loss, a bit devastated with my performance and could've done better, but we put up a fight on every match to our best potential at that moment</p>
<p><strong>-Sky-</strong>: I'm doing great, im a bit disappointed with the match but overall happy with our tournament performance</p>
<p><strong>I'm sorry that you guys are eliminated from 4DMWC. The bright side is that you didn't get eliminated in the first semi-finals match as you won against Japan. But unfortunately, Hong Kong was there for you guys as you guys got swept by Hong Kong in the conditional match. What happened to the USA during the Semi-finals week?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: They just got the better of us tbh. We went all out but it just wasn't enuf. I def made some questionable choices n i'm a lil sad about that, but they were just the better team today :shrugFreg:</p>
<p><strong>-Sky-</strong>: I think something in us died after we lost against Singapore, something just felt off about the team. Everyone (except for znow) was demotivated and didn't want to grind out the mappool. I think miscalculating our opponent and a bit of bad luck also seemed to push us to lose against HK.</p>
<p><strong>Znow</strong>: I was being too stubborn and thought I had the entire plan in my head, I watched Hong Kong vs United Kingdom and I thought we had it all, I was so certain that my thought process would work but I should've listened to Seth's concerns about it. I thought that we could easily gain our points in SV 2. as for the rest of it, I just threw really hard and under performed.</p>
<p><strong>Scep</strong>: I honestly was being really phased by the unreal talent that was presented this year and other teams respectfully, as someone who had entered this tournament years prior, the talent and team effort has evolved immensely since then and it did take a huge toll for some of us.</p>
<p><strong>Retina</strong>: I was definitely starting to worry about my client a lot. Considering what was happening with Znow and I's client always messing with my gameplay making me have to hit 25 ms earlier, I couldn't really feel too prepared for the upcoming matches and kinda just tried to wing it as best as I could. Unfortunately one person can only do so much for a team. My client has always bugged at least once per match we play. In Thailand's match, I believe the speed pick, my client had the bug where I have to hit 25 ms early, but I managed to V1 SS it if I recall correctly.</p>
<p><strong>(For Znow) So I noticed you disconnected not once, but twice during your match vs Hong Kong. Was it the same technical issues you were dealing with? And had if you didn’t get disconnected, did you think the United States would’ve won on those maps based on what the rest got.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Znow</strong>: It seems like it was the same issue but in a different way somehow. The first time the map loaded weirdly with the background not loading as I do not play with background dim. My game crashed at the very last note but I managed to have it recorded. That map we were losing regardless of my score. The second time against Hong Kong my game crashed midway with the background loading so I thought we were fine. I'm not really sure if we would've gotten the point seeing how I performed on everything else.</p>
<p><strong>For the United States, did you feel like this team performed up into the team's expectations? Any takeaways from the Semi-Finals week?</strong></p>
<p><strong>_Seth</strong>: In terms of all of the tournament I feel like everyone on our team has really stepped up in their own way.  When I was picking the team I didn't really know where we'd land at all. I'm just glad we finally got past QF's and I hope the perception of 4dm's team USA is a little better. Ideally I would like to return for one more year, and if not I'm confident USA will be left in very competent hands.
As for Semi-Finals, my takeaway is physical is going to be a hot commodity for future 4dm's and tournaments in general. Seeing the progression of the pools is really scary, and is gonna be a big push for me to really start getting more physical as a player.</p>
<p><strong>Znow</strong>: I’m really proud of my teammates and I couldn’t have asked any other teammates. I’m sure there were times where we could’ve done better but we did good in my opinion. I didn’t have very good expectations for late game so seeing how we performed really surprised me. I guess the main takeaway from all of this is to always believe in your teammates and to have a strong connection because without friendships it isn’t a team, it’s just a bunch of people trying to do different things.</p>
<p><strong>-Sky-</strong>: I have to agree with Znow here, im incredibly proud of everyone and how we did throughout the entire tournament, everyone really tried their best to get the highest scores they could despite the challanges. Scep even picked up SV just so we could have a extra sv player.</p>
<p><strong>Retina</strong>: I think Znow really hit it with that response. In the end, our team mates were the absolute best and i couldn't have asked for any others. Regardless of the outcome, we still did our very best until the very end. :)</p>
<p><strong>The United States does have the most signups as 60 different players from the United States signed up this year. Is there any future possibilities based on interest &amp; potential, that 4DMWC will see the United States back on top?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Znow</strong>: I definitely think it’s possible, if we have the same line up we have for next year I wouldn’t be surprised. Although I don’t see myself being able to participate but anything can happen. I’ve seen the huge improvement of -Sky-, Charlie, and even Retina so if they decide to sign up next year I have no doubts they’ll make it and guide the USA team to the top.</p>
<p><strong>Retina</strong>: Oh definitely, maybe we might get some new and oldcomers again next year on the team. I'm still debating whether or not I should join next year as I'm noticing the increase in difficulty these maps, especially since I've played throughout the past 3 years and saw it all change each year. I like to think of it like the 4 digit metas are changing, which kinda makes me worry about how the upcoming year of 4dmwc's difficulty spike will look.</p>
<p><strong>-Sky-</strong>: I can definitely see the USA become the top team once again, just throughout the course of the tournament, some of the players who didn't make it on the team behind the scenes are already stronger than myself and maybe even a few others who did make it on the team. I'm sure with the fact that the USA usually gets a lot of signups, I wouldnt be surprised if next year some real insane players show up to dominate the scene.</p>
<p><strong>_Seth</strong>: Yeah. Although USA always has a lot of signups a bunch i'd say about 50% don't have tournament viable skillsets. So the the outcome is about 30 of those players you can consider for the team, and less that actually tryout. That's why I want to identify players now that are on the tournament path and try and cultivate that skill for next year. I'd say that USA is for sure on the upswing though esp next year.... I have my eye on a few players for sure... :eyes:</p>
<p><strong>Thank you guys for the time and I hope you guys enjoyed 4DMWC! Best of luck to all of you in the future.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Znow</strong>: Thank you, it was great to be a part of this and to be a part of the USA team, I wish you well.</p>
