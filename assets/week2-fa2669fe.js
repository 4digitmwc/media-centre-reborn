<h2>Contamination</h2>
<p>It’s only been 5 days since the Crescent Moon Lounge has opened a new kitchen headquarters in the capital of Zion. The days of serving deep fried prawns and seafood have been gruelling and torturously long, and at the end of the day my soul would have left my body in exhaustion. Yet, the turnover by our former manager and an appointment by the big boss has made me the new Head Chef of this branch.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I will be fighting against the long working hours of F&amp;B businesses, trying to get creative with the dishes and striking the taste buds of the residents of Zion. It’s the only way I can prove my skills as a chef, and potentially leave middle management for good. But I’m prepared and ready to face that.</p>
<p>Unlike on Earth, the ingredients we've packed from our old home were in high demand, and the supply was limited. Prices were rocket high and it is unsustainable to keep purchasing the same ingredients in the same amounts as before. Profits for the restaurant were slowly reducing to a net zero, and further reductions in profits will only lead to people being fired, or salaries being cut. In the worst scenario, I'll be out of a job in a few weeks, with no meal welfare or currency to sustain myself in this vast space.</p>
<p>Desperate as I was, I tried to find alternative ingredients and had the altered dishes tested with the other chefs, for example the <em>Plant-Based Meat</em>, but that did not taste like the original meat. That left us with the only other choice, which was to experiment with new recipes using exotic and radical ingredients, such as the curiously colourful meats being sold along the streets of Zion. Among these dishes, one of them took off amongst the kitchen staff: the <em>Zion Carbonara</em>.</p>
<p>I attach the recipe here along with this diary entry. Hopefully, one day, when this dish takes off, I can claim the credit where it’s due, and reap the rewards such that I may be able to buy myself a comfortable bed to sleep in. I await the day!</p>

<p><em>Hello? Is this thing on? I’m trying out this new audio log thingy assigned to me, but they
conveniently forgot the instruction manual.</em></p>
<p>Anyway, this is Researcher [EXPUNGED] of the ETI Research Department, currently stationed on the planet ethos-1547b, the time as of this recording is [REDACTED]. This is a formal
documentation of case COVID-1547-0.</p>
<p>At exactly 25:13 Stellar Uniform Time, a complaint had been filed by a customer stating that their
grape smoothie was not purple, but instead yellow.
This prompted a fierce quarrel between the
customer and Head Chef Leon, the latter insisting that it was purple. The security personnel who
reported this incident to ETI management confirmed that the smoothie was indeed “the most
obnoxious shade of yellow possible”.</p>
<p>Following the dissipation of the conflict, I was sent to conduct a generic eyesight test on the
kitchen staff, utilising a children’s drawing book with the words scratched off. It was discovered
that 79% of staff had difficulty distinguishing colour, with almost all of them reporting
monochromatic vision. Following a swift quarantine and contact tracing, the apparent source of
this condition was traced to the head chef, Leon.</p>
<p>Denying his inability to observe colour, Head Chef Leon stated that he had been inventing new
dishes with meats from the local wildlife, and had been including it in the meals of the ship’s crew
this past week, without the permission of the Medical and Ethics Departments. All suspected staff
were immediately quarantined and a sample of the alien flesh was brought to the lab for testing.</p>
<p>The following are the results from the tissue sample.</p>
<p>*** <em>Lab-0042</em> ***</p>
<ul>
<li>Overseer: Researcher [EXPUNGED]</li>
<li>Test Material: Unidentified Xenon Tissue of Planet ethos-1547b</li>
<li>Results

<li>33% Protein</li>
<li>21% Grey Matter</li>
<li>45% Water</li>
<li>1% Unidentified Microorganisms</li>

<li>Addendum: Attached is an image of the microorganisms found in the tissue sample through a
SEM, suspected to have similar properties to human viruses.</li>

<p><em><strong>End of Report</strong></em></p>

<p>..mit, why isn’t this thing working. Okay, I'm back. After further consultation with the board of
researchers, the above virus has been determined cause of the symptoms experienced by all
affected personnel. The designated identification name of this virus is “Cognitohazadrous Ocular
Vision Impairing Disease”, or COVID for short. The tissue sample was determined to have originated form the organism harika boretica, otherwise known as the Teal-Striped Kartried, a
native of this planet. This organism has a symbiotic relationship with the virus, with the virus
synthesising food for the organism by digesting lightwaves, akin to an advanced form of
photosynthesis. However, when introduced to the human body, the virus gathers in the cone cells located in the eyes, forming a layer that obstructs light from falling on the cones, thereby inhibiting coloured vision.</p>
<p>As head of research for this case, efforts have been made in the fabrication of an antidote,
however, the virus remains elusive and does not match any virus we have in our database. But
this will not deter us.</p>
<p>At least, not for now.</p>
