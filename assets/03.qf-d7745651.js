<h2>Picks</h2>
<p><strong>Japan</strong> starts off the match by going with the map they’ve played previously against <strong>Indonesia</strong>: <strong>SV1 (Concentration)</strong>! <strong>Japan</strong> previously played <strong>SV1</strong> against Indonesia, showed an incredible performance of <strong>2.913 million</strong> as a team. And in their 2nd try, <strong>Japan</strong> showed the audience why SVs is their strongest skillsets. Scoring <strong>2.953m points</strong>, with <strong>AxReo</strong> improving his first attempt from <strong>960k</strong> to <strong>991k</strong>! <strong>Sweden</strong> did their best to keep up by <strong>Japan</strong> won their pick by <strong>95.6k</strong> points.</p>
<p><strong>Sweden</strong> is now up to make their <em>first choice</em> of the match. <strong>Sweden</strong> has chose <strong>RC3 (Point / Counterpoint)</strong>! <strong>Sweden</strong> narrowly outscored <strong>Japan</strong> the first time these 2 teams played, with <strong>Sweden</strong> scoring <strong>2.955m</strong> to <strong>Japan</strong>’s <strong>2.943m</strong>. Before the map started, <strong>Japan</strong> went with the notable player swap from <strong>Ageha8239</strong> to their Team Captain: <strong>Mi0117</strong>. <strong>Ageha</strong> had the lowest score for <strong>Japan</strong> on <strong>RC3</strong>, scoring <strong>965k</strong> against <strong>Indonesia</strong>. This was an interesting map showdown as a lot of players struggled to find their consistency with the stamina map. But <strong>Japan</strong>’s swap player strategy paid off as <strong>Mi0117</strong> scored <strong>982k</strong>, and <strong>Japan</strong> improving their <strong>RC3</strong> score to <strong>2.958m</strong>! Taking their first break point against <strong>Sweden</strong> by <strong>20k points</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Japan</strong> having the rare luxury of not having 1, but <strong>2</strong> SV maps! So it was pretty clear they went with <strong>SV2 (Back and Forth)</strong> to get off to a hot 3-0 start. While <strong>Japan</strong> didn’t play this map because of Indonesia banning the map in their match, it didn’t bother <strong>Japan</strong> as they easily scored <strong>2.930m points</strong> to defeat <strong>Sweden</strong> by <strong>90k points</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Sweden</strong> then decided to go with their protect pick <strong>RC5 (Alain)</strong>. In the map, <strong>Sweden</strong> got off to a strong start against <strong>Japan</strong>, having better ratio than <strong>Japan</strong> as all players fced the first part, until <strong>NeonDrakon</strong> broke at the end of the first quarter. Shortly after, <strong>Johnney101</strong> would find a break, giving the lead to <strong>Japan</strong>. Everyone hitting the Jacks perfectly until <strong>AxReo</strong> hit the start of a mini burst session too early! The score flickers as <strong>Sweden</strong> ratio game is still perfectly consistent as <strong>Sweden</strong> holds a narrow lead over <strong>Japan</strong> before the final kiai. <strong>NeonDrakon</strong> &amp; <strong>AxReo</strong> trade breaks but <strong>diamondBlaze</strong> lost his FC at the last kiai! That seals the deal as <strong>Japan</strong> takes their <em>2nd break point</em> thanks to FCs from <strong>Mi0117 &amp; Shirokuma1022</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Japan</strong> with a 4-0 lead, goes with their protect pick <strong>LN1 (New Genesis)</strong>! This was the only map <strong>Japan</strong> has a better score than <strong>Sweden</strong> the first time these 2 teams played <strong>LN1</strong>. And <strong>Japan</strong> would only improved on LN1 by <strong>22k</strong>, as <strong>Sweden</strong> struggled on playing LN1, <strong>Japan</strong> has <strong>double FCs</strong> from <strong>Mi0117 &amp; yakik</strong>.</p>
<p>Now down 0-5, <strong>Sweden</strong> is now 1 point away from elimination. <strong>Sweden</strong> has decided to go with the map they hadn’t played before: <strong>RC1 (Blockbuster)</strong>! Luckily for <strong>Sweden</strong>, despite that <strong>Ageha8239</strong> did improve on the first attempt, Ageha is the only player to get a 98%, as <strong>Sweden</strong> finally wins their first point to make it <strong>1-5</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Japan</strong> responds back by picking <strong>LN3 (Quo Vadis)</strong>! <strong>Sweden</strong> did play this map against the <strong>Netherlands</strong>, scoring <strong>2.863m points</strong>. And <strong>Sweden</strong> scored approximately <strong>974k per player</strong>. Total score 2.923m. Not only did <strong>Sweden</strong> improve by <strong>60k points</strong>, they also managed to defeat <strong>Japan</strong> on LN3! <strong>Sweden</strong> took their <em>first break point</em> in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Sweden</strong> going back into the Rice department by going with <strong>RC2 (GAS GAS GAS)</strong>! The speed map that <strong>Sweden</strong> is desperately looking to make an effort to continue their efforts of a reverse sweep vs <strong>Japan</strong>. Just like RC3, <strong>Japan</strong> will make the same player swap with <strong>Mi0117</strong> playing for <strong>Ageha8239</strong>. <strong>Mi0117</strong> had the better score than <strong>Ageha8239</strong>. But unfortunately, just like Ageha, <strong>Mi0117</strong> also had a <strong>98% performance</strong> as <strong>Sweden</strong> would take advantage of the speed map to score their <strong>3rd straight point</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Japan</strong> decides to go with <strong>HB2 (Amazing Mirage)</strong>. A map <strong>Sweden</strong> did have a score on, but not <strong>Japan</strong>. This may be a cake walk for <strong>Sweden</strong>, but unfortunately, <strong>diamondBlaze</strong> had technical issues during the match that ultimately gave <strong>Japan</strong> a huge lead. And despite the efforts from <strong>Sweden</strong> trying to close the gap, <strong>Japan</strong> would ultimately score huge. Defeating <strong>Sweden</strong> on their last pick by the score of <strong>6-3</strong>.</p>
