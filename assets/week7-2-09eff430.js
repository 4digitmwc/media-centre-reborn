<p><strong>So Logan, this is your 3rd time hosting 4DMWC for this year! Considering you did take a hiatus from the 2022 iteration, how did you adapt to the new tournament considering a lot has changed since you first entered in 4DMWC as a player for the very first tournament?</strong></p>
<p>Logan636: My number one goal coming back to hosting was to keep the streak of getting more signups than last year and making this the biggest 4dm yet. While numbers obviously don't mean everything, I've always been in awe at how much this tournament has grown since the first edition which barely got 16 full teams and so I always aspire to keep that trend of growth. I'll talk more on this later but the biggest part of executing this series in a way that it sustains growth and growth in quality is by looking for people more talented and specialized than me in many areas as to never limit the tournament to just what I can do. I've always tried to make this tournament series feel more like a community hub for improving players rather than an event that fades in and fades out every year, and judging by how active it is during even the farthest times from the tournament, I think I've done a decent job selecting people who make this series feel special. :)</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the first tournament, you were a player in the inaugural 4DMWC tournament! So I want to ask how did you transition from being a player for the United States Team to being a Host for 4DMWC 2020?</strong></p>
<p>Logan636: The short answer to this is more simple than you'd likely imagine but the bigger context behind why I wanted to host a second 4dm is a pretty personal story that I've never really publicly told but eh screw it, why not? I'm someone who never draws the line on if i'm getting too emotional or personal (and i'm sure everyone who knows me is aware) but without getting into too much detail, the period between the first 4dm ending and my decision to host another 4dm was the darkest time i've been through. Everything around me was crumbling and I pushed away pretty much everyone who was trying to help me. At that time, playing mania every day was about the only thing keeping me sane. While it was unhealthy and sad in a lot of ways, focusing on the game so much made me really interested in becoming more than just another tournament player. That interest gave me a strong drive to prove I could be more, so while gaining experience as a referee and streamer, I also endeavored in finding as many maps as I could that many didn't know of and making mock map pools. This slowly morphed into actually making pool drafts for a future 4dm edition as it was just a hypothetical I let my brain run away with. Eventually, I had enough confidence in myself to ask the 4dm1 host Turtwig (known then as Fletch) if I could host another edition and was met with a pretty instant yes as he had no real plan to. I also asked the 4dm1 poolers if they'd like to return and they all said yes which was amazing, and from there the rest is really historyâ€¦ 4dm2 began planning and during the time it launched and was going, I actually saw huge improvements in my mental and academic health as I had felt like I did something successful and proved that I could be more than a player.</p>
<p><strong>So as a Coordinator, you share the Host role with DannyPX &amp; Paturages. How did you 3 split up into who's in charge of which department that needs to be covered? In terms of the biggest staff team 4DMWC has seen this year?</strong></p>
<p>Logan636: To start, I'd like to say the 3 consultants: Orca, Polytetral and Albionthegreat deserve just as much credit as us 3 hosts do and I'm sure the other hosts would agree as the consultants really did just as much as us. When it came to divvying roles up, the most important thing was recognizing the talent in others and being sure everyone was able to shine their brightest while covering all bases needed for the tournament and that extends far beyond just hosting roles. Danny has always been such a great person to have around as he excels in pretty much any role, and for this edition he spearheaded the graphics, collaborated heavily with albion to be sure all management related things I wasn't covering were covered, and generally being there to even do some simple reffing when he wanted. Paturages hosting duties were kind of taken up by him literally carrying in the SV pooling department but even outside of that I think he did a lot in terms of helping whether that be with his 3am playtesting or being very responsive when help was needed making an executive call or helping with whatever else was needed. My biggest contribution to the tournament was easily gathering the staff, generally overseeing the progress as it was carried out in all areas and communicating to incorporate player feedback as best as possible, it involved a lot of cooperation with everyone around. As well, I let many other vital roles like directing the media center or heading map selection or being sure every match was adequately staffed fall into hands outside of our hosts and I'm so grateful for Demi, HowToPlayLN and again Poly, Orca, and Albion for all their work. While this edition was far from perfect in terms of being airtight levels of organized, I definitely think this is the strongest core of hosts, consultants and other head staff we have had and it pulled us through to the end.</p>
<p><strong>As a Coordinator, you were challenged to meet the players' expectations in terms of every aspect to make 4DMWC a success every year. How are you able to not only maintain the consistency to make this tournament a success, but also to make 4DMWC grow to become one of the most prestigious tournaments in the mania scene?</strong></p>
<p>I think the biggest priority here will always be on targeting potential blind spots or weak points within previous editions of a tournament where things can be made better. And then from there, appointing talented people where there talent can shine to fill those gaps. For this edition, we definitely targeted a few specific things such as making map pools more diverse and interesting than ever before, developing a skillban system that can make a greater portion of players happy than ever before and allowing the creative processes of mappers, the media center and even the song creators to flow a little more than in previous years where I felt it necessary to monitor everything. I never want 4dm to feel like a stale tournament series that just happens to happen every year so it's always great to see ways in which we can expand in creativity and improve player interest.</p>
<p><strong>What is the future holding for Logan636 following the conclusion of 4DMWC 2023? I know it's grueling work year after year to organize months of preparation in advance to get 4DM up and running.</strong></p>
<p>Logan636: Honestly, in terms of osu, I'm not sure what the future of Logan636 is. Even though I'm far from my prime as a player. I feel truly tied to the mania tournament scene and I can't tell whether it's an anchor to my life or not. It's so polarizing to think about because on one side, I did truly prove to myself that I can be more than just another player so many times now and so I should be satisfied. However, I'll always see something greater that both this series and that I as a community figure could be. There's a point where this dichotomy drives me crazy and that's when I start to snap and become some angry person who I know I no longer am so I need to just stop stressing myself out about it. Either way, I definitely think I've made my mark on this series and have much else to focus on in life. I would love to move to other things in this game and maybe even dive head first into a new hobby altogether, and I will certainly be taking a break from tournament staffing for a little while, but I will still likely be around these parts.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think 4DM will be in the future? Do you see 4DMWC will continue to raise the expectations &amp; quality of the tournament, while also adapting to the new meta of talented 4 digit players for years to come?</strong></p>
<p>Logan636: I have so many visions of what this series could become but I think no matter which of them comes true, I think 4DM will always remain something a bit more than just a tournament series. I'm so grateful for the community-centered culture that has been developed here and as long as that is maintained, I think 4DM will be a hotbed of new ideas and pushed boundaries for a long time to come no matter who is managing it. I know this is my shortest answer by a lot, but I'm pretty confident the interest in 4DM won't fizzle out anytime soon as long as we have visionaries who continue to push it outside of itself.</p>
<h2>DannyPX</h2>
<p><strong>Hello DannyPX! Thanks for taking this time to answer some questions! But before we begin, I just want to ask how are you doing on this day?</strong></p>
<p>DannyPX: Pretty good! Trying to take a break after 4DM, but other management roles has keeping me busy :sweat_smile:</p>
<p><strong>So you are a Coordinator/Host for the 3rd year in a row! How did 4DMWC have gone for you this year compared to the last 2 years you were a Coordinator/Host for this tournament?</strong></p>
<p>DannyPX: It went pretty well as I must say. I did however went more of a back-end role compared to the other hosts. Mostly just dealing with smaller tasks, like scheduling, some sheets, contacting teams if necessary and just keeping things tidy.</p>
<p>In a more global scheme, compared to last year, bigger numbers, more custom songs, more staff. Yeah it was a massive success. Quite happy with it! (Not a single WBD, how is that possible?!)</p>
<p><strong>You are a well known staffer with a resume of tournaments that you've hosted/staffed for. Over the years, you've seen the highs and lows of tournaments. How did the experience helped you adapt into the changing meta of the mania tournament scene over the years?</strong></p>
<p>DannyPX: Well, I'm quite sure people know me more of my charts in mania. I do however have the same mindset for both charting and managing. Experimenting and keeps things flowing. Experimenting with new formats, metas of even just the process of how to schedule staff/players. It is a big important step to keep things fresh, make things more efficient to do, and keeping it stress free. I always strive to make sure that my staff, are stress free.</p>
<p>Lately I've been trying to make bigger experiments on new tournaments. (wink shameless plug BNL, and COT in the future). I really want to see newer formats to keep things fun! Having the same old format must get boring right?</p>
<p><strong>What was one thing you enjoyed about 4DMWC this year, and what is the future of you for 4DMWC?</strong></p>
<p>DannyPX: Seeing new staff in our family. It's always fun to see new people grow with big opportunities. <em>The biggest community mania tournament</em>, as your first tournament to staff?! Awesome right! Like <strong>YOU</strong> haha</p>
<p><strong>Like me?</strong></p>
<p>DannyPX: Interviewing in such a big setting</p>
<p><strong>Funny considering how I got rejected to commentate for SOFT 6, and now all of a sudden, in 1 year, I went from a nobody to a somebody that surprisingly, way too many people cares about me LOL</strong></p>
<p>DannyPX: We always try to accept a lot of people for 4DM, to build experience. Gotta start somewhere c:</p>
<p><strong>I had one year of experience before I joined 4DMWC 2023 haha! But I will admit 4DMWC has been the biggest growth in terms of commentary. Now people are saying, Pork for 4kMWC 2023 commentary when?</strong></p>
<p>DannyPX: Haha! 4DM is a funny but great experience. Lots of people are watching c: And lots of moments will be remembered</p>
<h2>Paturages</h2>
<p><strong>Bonjour Paturages! How are you doing today?</strong></p>
<p>Doing great! I pretty much just got back from an extensive break and vacation and I'm ready</p>
<p>to catch up once again!</p>
<p><strong>You are a Coordinator for the first time in 4DMWC this year! As someone who's switched from being a champion for France last year, how did the transition went for you in a year span?</strong></p>
<p>Paturages: After winning last year's edition, staffing for the following year was essentially a no-brainer, as I deemed that my job for the French team was done. I initially intended to contribute as a more behind-the-scenes general pooler and staffer as a whole, but the hosting opportunity was offered to me and I decided to take it knowing that the other hosts would have my back on the parts of hosting I was less comfortable with. To address the transitioning question, as an already active and experienced staffer, I don't really view it as a transition. Rather, I see it as a direct continuation to what I was already doing in terms of tournament staffing. Many hosts and staffers are also active competitive players who really just want to give back to the community once in a while, and I still consider myself as an active player before being a staffer.</p>
<p>I already had prior hosting experience with MBS3 and that was a pretty hectic learning experience, but 4DMWC is a quite different environment with different people who work in different ways, so knowing how to adapt to other staff is key to making the tournament a comfortable and successful experience not only for yourself, but for everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>So from Logan, you are mostly involved with the mappooling side of things in the tournament, and I heard you kept a very close eye on the SV department of the mappooling team. Especially with custom songs and custom maps were made for this tournament specifically, what was the process like for you to work with the SV team?</strong></p>
<p>Paturages: Soooooo SV pooling was extremely funny! We invited a good amount of SV mappers with the intention to provide at least a decent amount of custom maps for the tournament, as it was the case for last year, and to mirror the fully custom mapped MWC 2022. We didn't quite go with the expectation to get 100% custom map coverage, so we definitely had non-custom alternatives and backups in mind.</p>
<p>I am personally very thankful to all of the SV mappers who contributed to this tournament, they were absolutely lovely to work with. They were also active pretty early on in the pooling and the mapping process. Essentially, the whole SV custom mapping process goes as follows: you get a draft out, players test it out for feedback and to gauge how it fits within the overall mappool (pairing within the round + overall difficulty curve), and you iterate until it's good. Sometimes, the first draft just works: that was the case for most of early game picks.</p>
<p>With that said, the SV mapping and balancing process is not an easy one, and many maps were</p>
<p>actually completed quite late in the process. My own maps were essentially speedmapped either one week in advance, or sometimes days before the showcase. One of them was actually recycled from another scrapped tournament. Many other edits and modifications are usually done on the week leading up to showcase, as priorities during the tournament usually focus on polishing the next mappool... and then the directly following ones if we can.</p>
<p>As you can see, mapping and pooling management in practice requires you to still be reactive even if you plan things in advance, because expectations may change during the tournament according to player performance and feedback. This is also why poolers have less incentive to plan in advance, but more and more efforts are made to do that because it is quite stressful otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>As a first time coordinator for 4DMWC, it was a lot of work for you but you managed to complete it all alongside DannyPX &amp; Logan636. What was one thing you enjoyed about 4DMWC throughout the whole process from the planning to the finale? And what is your future of 4DMWC heading into future iterations?</strong></p>
<p>Paturages: My favorite part about staffing is seeing people enjoying themselves and being enthusiastic about what they do, no matter what role, big or small, they take. It may be some hype commentary, banger mapping, some occasional cathartic referee and streaming chaos or even just enjoying the mappool as a player, but I believe that tournament staffing lives and dies by people being enthusiastic and proactive bringing their own contributions to the table.</p>
<p>That motivation in turn encourages other people to follow up with their own contributions, and in my experience this is pretty much how we manage to keep the tournament scene alive, especially with more and more new blood coming in.</p>
<p>My future in 4DMWC staffing will be much more withdrawn: in fact, I will most likely position myself as a player once again for the French team, this time hopefully playing more of a role than just the token SV player. I will happily leave the staffing to the many new faces that have experienced the full 4DMWC behind the scenes experience, and to the new ones that want to leave their own footprint in the tournament scene.</p>
