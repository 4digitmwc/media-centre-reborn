Along with the staple tournaments such as 4DM and SOFT, many ambitious projects have come to pass. New minigames format, unique pooling constraints, and drafting systems have been proposed and executed to go with the hyper-competitive gameplay we all love.</p>
<p>It is one thing to start a tournament with passion, but what really ensures that staffs strive to give their best week after week of labour, players continue to buy your idea with enthusiasm, and leave spectators craving for more following every stage? In other words, what makes a tournament truly succeed beyond simple completion?</p>
<p>As I lived my year with hosting o!mLN3 and watching other tournaments happen, I found myself circling back to this question very often. Many tournaments that come to pass live a short life, failing to retain staff and players. We end up relying on the same few tournaments to fill up our yearly calendars, leading to the same personnel assuming leadership. Year after year, veterans experience a long-lasting cycle of staffing torment among growing responsibilities in real life.</p>
<p>What exactly is causing this drought in successful tournaments? This is the question I had several staffing units and individuals answer over the past 3 days, and I got many enthusiastic answers. It turns out that experience, communication and good work ethic are among some of the most cited reasons for the success of a tournament, rather than the involvement of money, flashy trailers or graphics.</p>
<p>If you're new to tournament organization, some of these advices from other hosts may be worth a listen.</p>
<h2><strong>Experience (and by extension, a competent staffing team)</strong></h2>
<p>It should come off as no surprise that a host of a tournament and some of their subordinates be HEAVILY involved in the roles they assume experience in. <strong>Hosting a tournament is very different from simply being a player in a tournament</strong>. As a player, you only see the fun parts of it - the pools you are to compete on, the competition being commentated on by casters who make a match sound exciting, and the prizes (if you've gotten far enough to think about that). As a host, you will see that the prize money does not drop from the sky, that good casting cannot even happen if you don't have a referee, or a streamer with good setup and knowledge, that a good pool does not bubble out with pure luck, but with long planning and preparation. Even the most experienced referees and mappoolers can get overwhelmed without the provision of a good referee sheet. For mappers to help produce good maps that fit in pools, they need rounds of feedback and playtesting. These are all things that form part of the staffing ecosystem. Without knowing at least how some of these functions work behind the scenes, do not expect to get out of your hosting job alive.</p>
<p>This also goes for the overall experience level of the staffing team you endorse for help from. It is always recommended to have a few veterans for consultation while introducing new faces who can likely add young-blooded passion to the staffing team. In the event that you, as an inexperienced host, need to know how some tournament functions work, experienced staffs are the ones with an obligation to pass down knowledge; you can consult them for guidance. However, they will be occupied with staffing a couple more tournaments, and if you're not familiar with them, chances are that your tournament is not the one they would like to focus on, and they may want to delegate more ground work to others. That being said, this is where the passionate new-gen staffs come in. With a relatively lower level of exhaustion from staffing and a burning will to learn, these staffs will come in handy given the right advice from the right people. All in all, <strong>a good mix of old and new staffs is ideal for the success of your tournament</strong> and the growth of the staffing scene.</p>
<h2><strong>Time</strong></h2>
<p>This is another aspect that even the most experienced staffing teams end up struggling with - time constraints. Ultimately, osu!mania is an unpaid hobby at large, and to expect everyone to spend part of their precious working/studying time on something they'll likely not receive tangible returns on is ridiculous. It is very reasonable that a single custom mapper may only be able to provide 1 map for the pool (if only given 8 tournament weeks to map), and that a referee may only be free to staff for 1-2 weeks of the tournament.</p>
<p>If this is already not explicit enough, <strong>make sure to respect the time your staffs put in for the tournament</strong>. Make them feel appreciated for helping out at your tournament, because it is likely volunteer work (and even if not, do not let money be the only reason they're sold). Accept staffs on the understanding that they may not contribute as much as they wanted/promised to do, and always have that plan B in mind should someone leave a production gap, whether it is a referee who gets into a real emergency, or a mapper failing to deliver their commissioned map.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if this is not already obvious, even the most well-planned tournaments get hiccups, and sometimes really big ones that require you to backtrack through weeks of planning. <strong>Give yourself ample time to mess up</strong>. Now here's an example that has likely happened before: Your custom song for the Grand Finals Tiebreaker is missing, or worse still, completed 1-2 weeks before pool release, but unsuitable for charting. In any of these events, it should only make sense to settle for a Plan B, but give your team enough time to execute this Plan B. A reasonable buffer time for failure would be 1 month, but staff responsiveness and experience plays a huge part in extending/shortening the time required for this.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>DO NOT TRY TO RUSH TOURNAMENT PRODUCTION.</strong> It normally ends up in huge disarray and inevitable delays to the tournament. Have a reasonably long timeline that managers/staffs can constantly refer to, have them understand their deadlines and stick to them, and give them (in)tangible incentives for spending their time working on your tournament.</p>
<h2><strong>Communication</strong></h2>
<p>This is something that does not seem to be talked about often when it boils down to not only tournaments, but also in workplaces. <strong>COMMUNICATION IS KEY.</strong> As a tournament organizer, you are obliged to observe the behaviour of your staffs and to ask them if they truly enjoy what they are doing, if they do not respond to their calls of duty. If they are enjoying it but struggling to meet deadlines for personal reasons, suggest a solution or help them feel better. This is not only for clarity sake, but also to enhance effective engagement and help staffs feel cared for.</p>
<p>That being said, being able to exert your influence as an executive is also equally as important. If your mappoolers/mappers need to establish difficulty scaling, or if your referees require a crash course in staffing, <strong>conduct voice calls and hold meetings</strong>. Make sure your staff members attend the meetings to establish standards, and take minutes for those who missed the meetings. These are the important points to note for your team going forward, and it is then up to the staff to keep themselves informed so they can contribute to the project.</p>
<p>More than often not, it is these acts of engagement that keep the staff motivated to work towards your goals, and keep them WANTING to be productive. <strong>Treat each staff you meet in this tournament like a respected co-worker, and a good friend.</strong> Chances are, you'll end up with a team united by the beginnings of the tournament, but bound by friendships, in the end and beyond the tournament.</p>
<h2><strong>Management</strong></h2>
<p>Do not underestimate your influences as the overall manager of the tournament. This is also closely linked to the previous points on communication and experience. While talking to your staffs, make sure to know what you are saying or doing, and to back up your decisions with reasonable arguments. If you ever feel stuck on the crossroads for what to do following an emergency, make sure to also consult other concerned managers and staffs for advice. Chances are, if you acknowledge your shortcomings/inabilities and communicate problems effectively with your teammates, they are more likely to be able to provide you with a better alternative to your problems.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, <strong>be a nice supervisor to work with</strong>. Make sure that goals for the tournament are clearly communicated, and money should NOT be one of those reasons. Encourage your teams to collaborate with one another, to help each other when in need, and to provide recognition/feedback to one another.</p>
<p>This is how a team (not just in the realm of staffing tournaments) grows in both technical prowess and team cohesion, and this is your exact job as a tournament host/manager. Make sure to do this right.</p>
<h2><strong>Innovation (done right)</strong></h2>
<p>There are definitely many ways to achieve this. Through the minigame-styled Benelux 2022 format, or the BHM Hololive-centric pools, or the Combro Cup draft format (or even this media center), it is definitely possible to make your tournament get a fresh twist and feel interesting. These ideas are endless; the sky is the limit when it comes down to which ideas can be generated and executed. However, I am not here to discuss about the innovation. I am here to discuss about how feasible the innovation is.</p>
<p>In an osu!mania tournament, there is so much you can do given its logistical constraints. If you are to discuss about a drafting format for the tournament, do expect that timezone differences between players will be an inevitable issue. If your bracket is not 1v1 but a 1v1v1v1, then the dynamics of a match will play differently and commentators have to be aware of this.</p>
<p>This is just but one of the examples, where your initial idea executes different from usual. To be aware of such issues, <strong>playtest and proof your innovation to make sure the execution is effective</strong>. Make sure that your innovation does not cause more trouble than benefit to your players, and know the conditions where execution of such an innovation might fail. If you know these conditions, failproof them with rules. Otherwise, a generic tournament format might just work better than your innovation, which I would bluntly call an innovation failure.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>There are just so many more takeaways I can note down, but this is as much as I want to say without going too deep into silly lore or grandma stories.</p>
<p>All in all, 2022 is coming to a close and crazy tournaments are on the rise. You're a tournament host who wants to ensure your tournament is a success, and you might be new to the whole insanity. Want to know how to ensure your tournament is a success and keep people wanting more?</p>
<p>As a host, learn to manage the team well. Be compassionate and understanding. Be serious to learn about every function that happens backend. Know the veteran staff, and the potential newbies alike, and have both in your team. Failproof your ideas, and always be ready for Plan Bs. The decisions that lead up to success then come naturally, and you may then place your mark in tournament history.</p>
<p>Be ambitious, but also be cautious of what you do. Stay safe everyone.</p>
