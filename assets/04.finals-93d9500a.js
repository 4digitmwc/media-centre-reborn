<p><strong>Brazil</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong> had lost from the Winner's Semi-finals against <strong>China</strong> &amp; <strong>Singapore</strong> retrospectively. Both of the teams had mixed results against <strong>Hong Kong</strong> &amp; <strong>Malaysia</strong> before the 3rd place battle. Canada went through a match with Malaysia as <strong>Canada</strong> breezed through the Match <strong>7-1</strong>. <strong>Brazil</strong> on the other hand, went through a <em>tough</em> battle against Hong Kong as they narrowly won the match <strong>7-5</strong>. Despite playing most of the mappool, both teams played <strong>7</strong> maps together from the mappool as <strong>Brazil</strong> does have the advantage over Canada on <strong>RC4, RC5, RC7, HB1, &amp; LN1.</strong> Canada had the advantage against Brazil on <strong>RC6 &amp; SV2.</strong> What makes this match even more interesting is that these 2 teams met twice in <strong>4DMWC 2022</strong>. Brazil defeated Canada 5-0 in <strong>Winner's Round of 16</strong> , before Canada was able to get the last laugh as they narrowly defeated Brazil's run in <strong>4DMWC 2022</strong> in the <strong>Loser's Finals</strong> by the score of <strong>7-5</strong>. This match isn't more than just who gets <strong>3rd Place.</strong> This is a match where revenge is on the player's minds from last year's woes.</p>
<h2>Protects &amp; Bans</h2>
<p>Brazil narrowly won the rolls as <strong>Zergh</strong> rolls a 77, while <strong>svp-</strong> rolls a 73. <strong>Brazil</strong> wants to protect <strong>LN1</strong>. This is the <em>coordination pick</em> where <strong>Brazil</strong> is favored to defeat <strong>Canada</strong> by <strong>43k points</strong>. <strong>Canada</strong> will select <strong>SV1</strong> as their protect pick. For the bans, <strong>Brazil</strong> will ban <strong>SV2</strong> &amp; <strong>Canada</strong> will ban <strong>LN4</strong>. Both of the bans are pretty <em>strategic</em> as <strong>Brazil</strong> bans <strong>SV2</strong> since <strong>Canada</strong> outscores <strong>Brazil</strong> by at least <strong>200k points</strong> , and <strong>Canada</strong> bans <strong>LN4</strong>. A <em>tech LN map</em> that tests on Grace LN note placements, with some tricky inverse &amp; release sections throughout the map. Also does help for <strong>Canada</strong> that <strong>Brazil</strong> scored <strong>2.925m points</strong> on the map.</p>
<h2>Picks</h2>
<p><strong>Brazil</strong> is now up first and they will pick <strong>LN3 (Albion after the dawn (Cut Ver.))</strong>! Despite <strong>Canada</strong> making their best efforts keeping up with a strong LN team that is <strong>Brazil</strong> , <strong>Holo the Wise/AmariaLove</strong> &amp; <strong>twitch chat</strong> would find unfortunate breaks that is more than enough for <strong>Brazil</strong> to breeze through the map. <strong>Brazil</strong> wins the map by <strong>17k points</strong> as <strong>nayeonie bunny</strong> &amp; <strong>maykee kee</strong> FCs the map.</p>
<p>Down by 1, <strong>Canada</strong> responds back with <strong>RC5 (Energy Synergy Matrix)!</strong> This is a bold pick by <strong>Canada</strong>. Despite the Rice maps being Canada's <em>strongest</em> skill sets, <strong>Brazil</strong> actually has the upper hand heading into the match with <strong>Brazil</strong> scoring <strong>2.898m</strong> against <strong>Hong Kong</strong> , to <strong>Canada</strong> scoring <strong>2.862m</strong> against <strong>Malaysia</strong>. <strong>Axelerrixx</strong> had an early drop, giving <strong>Brazil</strong> a good start ahead. <strong>Buvuw</strong> would follow it up with a break, but <strong>twitch chat</strong> &amp; <strong>Jeyfor</strong> will break for their retrospective teams. Heading into the kiai, <strong>Buvuw</strong> &amp; <strong>Zurgh</strong> would find breaks! And while <strong>Axelerrixx</strong> &amp; <strong>twitch chat</strong> did break a few more times, <strong>Zurgh's</strong> losing the final FC for <strong>Brazil</strong> &amp; <strong>Buvuw's</strong> chain breaks was enough for <strong>Canada</strong> to take the point at the last minute. <strong>Canada</strong> scored <strong>2.891m points</strong>. Which was enough to beat <strong>Brazil</strong> by <strong>16k points</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Brazil</strong> will go with another LN map: <strong>LN2 (Pupa)</strong>! This is a density map that <strong>Canada</strong> did play this against <strong>Malaysia</strong> as <strong>Canada</strong> scored <strong>2.872m points</strong> against <strong>Malaysia</strong>. <strong>Canada</strong> had a slight lead against <strong>Brazil</strong> until the kiai section, where the <strong>Canadian players</strong> in the lobby all <strong>broke</strong> , giving the lead to <strong>Brazil</strong> , and that's what <strong>Brazil</strong> needed as <strong>Buvuw (FC)</strong> &amp; <strong>maykee kee</strong> took the top 2 scores in the lobby to make it <strong>2-1</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Canada</strong> then decided to go with their <em>protect</em> pick this early: <strong>SV1 (Get Down)</strong>! This is a <em>reading map</em> that both teams will be playing on this map for the first time in competition. Considering that <strong>Canada</strong> had a better score than <strong>Brazil</strong> on <strong>SV2</strong> , all you need to know is that <strong>Holo the Wise</strong> has the high score, and <strong>Canada</strong> won by over <strong>300k points</strong> , making it a tie <strong>2-2</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Brazil</strong> responded back with their <em>protected</em> pick: <strong>LN1 (Subete ga maboroshi ni natta nochi de)</strong>! This is a <em>coordination pick</em> that <strong>Brazil</strong> is favored by a <strong>43k point</strong> advantage over <strong>Canada</strong>. <strong>Canada</strong> opting to switch from <strong>[LS]Byte</strong>, who played the map against <strong>Malaysia</strong> to <strong>Axelerrixx</strong>. This switch is paying off for <strong>Canada</strong> as they're in the lead for 2/3 of the map, until the entire team <strong>breaks almost at the exact same time</strong>! Giving <strong>Brazil</strong> the lead. And despite <strong>nayeonie bunny</strong> &amp; <strong>Zergh</strong> did break near the end, <strong>Brazil</strong> almost had a triple FC but it was good enough to defeat <strong>Canada</strong> with <strong>maykee kee</strong> FC the map.</p>
<p>Down by 1 again ( <strong>3-2</strong> ), <strong>Canada</strong> has decided to go with <strong>HB1 (Nidhoggr)</strong>! This is a hybrid map where <strong>Brazil</strong> has a <strong>12k point</strong> advantage over <strong>Canada</strong> coming into this map. Before the map, <strong>Canada</strong> was almost forced to play without <strong>[LS]Byte</strong>, one of their players who had the top score for <strong>Canada</strong> on <strong>HB1</strong> against <strong>Malaysia</strong>. <strong>[LS]Byte</strong> just comes in with enough time to play. <strong>maykee kee</strong> will come in <strong>Zergh</strong> on HB1 when <strong>Zergh</strong> played <strong>HB1</strong> previously against <strong>Hong Kong</strong>. <strong>Brazil</strong> was holding on to a decent lead until <strong>Buvuw</strong> &amp; <strong>nayeonie bunny</strong> both lost their FCs at the last quarter of the map! This will give <strong>Canada</strong> the point thanks to FCs from <strong>[LS]Byte</strong> &amp; <strong>Axelerrixx</strong>!</p>
<p>A tie game at <strong>3-3</strong> , <strong>Brazil</strong> will choose <strong>RC7 (KARAKURI)</strong> as their next map! This is your <em>chordjack</em> map as <strong>Brazil</strong> has a <strong>37k point</strong> advantage over <strong>Canada</strong>. <strong>Brazil</strong> started off the map with the lead based on <em>accuracy</em> and has never looked back. <strong>Buvuw</strong> had a 994k performance as <strong>Brazil</strong> would improve their score by <strong>775 points</strong> , having a team score of <strong>2.961m points</strong> to take it <strong>4-3</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Canada</strong> would respond with <strong>RC6 (Kickstart My Heart)</strong>! This is the only map <strong>Canada</strong> has available on the map pool that has both teams played it before, but <strong>Canada</strong> has the better first performance than <strong>Brazil (Canada favored by 35k points)</strong>. <strong>twitch chat</strong> would find a really early break, giving the lead to <strong>Brazil</strong>. But <strong>Zergh</strong> losing his combo after the first quarter would give <strong>Canada</strong> the lead and has not looked back since. <strong>Canada</strong> scored <strong>2.926m points</strong> , defeating <strong>Brazil</strong> by <strong>41k points</strong> to make it <strong>4-4</strong>.</p>
<p>The first <strong>8</strong> picks were all from each team's own picks. <strong>Brazil</strong> looked to retake a map lead as they chose <strong>HB2 (AureoLe ~For Triumph~)</strong>! This is a <em>50/50 slot map</em> as <strong>Canada</strong> played this map before against <strong>Malaysia</strong> , scoring <strong>2.872m points</strong> the first time <strong>Canada</strong> played it. In the map, <strong>Brazil</strong> had a team reset at the start of the map, so <strong>Canada</strong> had a very comfortable lead for the first half, looking to possibly take the first <em>break point</em> of the match! Until <strong>twitch chat</strong> had 2 crucial breaks &amp; <strong>Axelerrixx</strong> losing the FC near the end. Giving the lead to <strong>Brazil</strong> within the last _ <strong>20 seconds</strong> _ of the map. And Brazil didn't look back as <strong>nayeonie bunny</strong> &amp; <strong>Zergh</strong> had the best 2nd &amp; 3rd player scores against <strong>[LS]Byte</strong> &amp; <strong>twitch chat</strong> , which was enough to give <strong>Brazil</strong> their <strong>5th</strong> point of the match.</p>
<p><strong>Canada</strong> has decided to go into their own uncharted territory, choosing <strong>RC1 (Scarlet Tears)</strong>! This is a <em>Jumpstream</em> map that has a ton of various different stream problems that blend in with the usual Jumpstream map. <strong>Canada</strong> hasn't played this map in competition, But <strong>Brazil</strong> scored <strong>2.881m points</strong> the first time they played it. <strong>Brazil</strong> had a good lead heading into the last quarter, until <strong>Buvuw</strong> lost his <strong>FC</strong> with a break, which still gave <strong>Brazil</strong> a decent lead, but a <em>huge</em> break from <strong>Buvuw</strong> within the last 8 seconds of the map left, giving the lead to <strong>Canada</strong> super late! And that's what <strong>Canada</strong> needed as <strong>Axelerrixx</strong> &amp; <strong>[LS]Byte</strong> would get FCs to give <strong>Canada</strong> their <strong>5th</strong> point of the match.</p>
<p>Now a <strong>BO3</strong> , <strong>Brazil</strong> has decided to go with <strong>RC3 (Ra Variationen)</strong>! This is a <em>mixed rice stamina</em> pick that <strong>Brazil</strong> played on this map previously. This was the map that <strong>Buvuw's</strong>** Full Comboed <strong>with an impressive</strong> 990k performance <strong>. However,</strong> Buvuw's <strong>struggles from</strong> RC1 <strong>have continued where it left off as</strong> Buvuw <strong>was constantly breaking throughout the map. That was more than enough to give</strong> Canada <strong>their</strong> 6th point <strong>of the match, and the</strong> first break point <strong>the match has seen after</strong> 10 straight points** were being given from each team's pick!</p>
<p>With <strong>Match Point &amp; Last Pick</strong> being given to the <strong>Canadians</strong> , <strong>Canada</strong> has picked <strong>RC4 (FUEL TANK)</strong>! A <em>mixed rice</em> map that has <strong>Brazil</strong> slightly favored over <strong>Canada</strong> by <strong>9k points</strong>. <strong>Brazil</strong> begins the map with an <strong>early lead</strong> , and despite <strong>Axelerrixx</strong> being the only player to get a <strong>FC</strong> in the lobby, <strong>twitch chat</strong> &amp; <strong>[LS]Byte</strong> had multiple breaks that would give <strong>Brazil</strong> their <strong>first and only break point</strong>. With this in mind, the score is now <strong>6-6</strong>. And we're heading into <strong>Tiebreaker</strong>!</p>
<h2>Tiebreaker</h2>
<p>Coming into the <strong>tiebreaker</strong> , <strong>Brazil</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong> had very limited time for who would be playing the tiebreaker. <strong>Canada</strong> going with <strong>Axelerrixx/[LS]Byte/twitch chat</strong>. The <strong>same lineup</strong> that was in the lobby for the last <strong>7</strong>** maps! <strong>While</strong> Brazil <strong>going with</strong> Zergh/maykee kee/Buvuw <strong>lineup to try to defeat</strong> Canada**.</p>
<p>The <strong>tiebreaker</strong> is here, <strong>twitch chat</strong> would struggle with consistency in the first section, giving <strong>Brazil</strong> a <strong>6k point</strong> lead after the <strong>first 30 seconds</strong> of the map. This is where it's a good thing for <strong>Brazil</strong> as they had such a huge lead, because everybody in the lobby is starting to <em>struggle</em> with <em>consistency</em>! <strong>Axelerrixx</strong> had his <strong>max combo chain</strong> of <strong>2,964</strong> before he broke, but it wasn't enough for <strong>Canada</strong> to come back as <strong>[LS]Byte</strong> &amp; <strong>twitch chat</strong> struggles to stay consistent, giving <strong>Brazil</strong> more time to get away with the lead! <strong>60% of the map in</strong> , after slowly catching up to <strong>Brazil</strong> , <strong>maykee kee</strong> would find a break that would give <strong>Canada</strong> for the first time since the start of the map. And <strong>Canada</strong> would go on to extend that lead, as everyone would struggle on the last section of the map! And because of that, the map is over. And after some initial <strong>confusion</strong> due to the <strong>stream client</strong> removing <strong>[LS]Byte</strong> that had the viewers confused that they thought <strong>Brazil</strong> won, the mp link was there and [LS]Byte did complete the map. And by <strong>official ruling: Canada would win the tiebreaker, and ultimately, the match.</strong></p>
<h2>Match Summary</h2>
<p>This match had it all for a <strong>3rd place battle</strong>. 2 great teams with <strong>interesting stories</strong> of how they got there. 2 teams wanting <strong>revenge</strong> for how both of them ruined each other's tournament runs back in <strong>4DMWC 2022</strong> , and both of them doing whatever it takes to make sure they're one step ahead of each other. The typical stereotypes of &quot; <strong>Brazil being extraordinary at LNs only &amp; Canada being strong in Rice</strong>&quot; was thrown off the window as each team looked very, very strong on all maps despite the breaks that have occurred. It was a <strong>strategic battle</strong> between both teams as <strong>10 points</strong> were given from their own picks, and <strong>2 points</strong> were breakpoints. And in the end, both teams looked so strong that it all came down to the <strong>tiebreaker</strong>. And despite losing <strong>2/3 hybrid maps</strong> , <strong>Canada</strong> was able to take the <strong>tiebreaker</strong> when <strong>it mattered the most</strong>. <strong>Canada</strong> will be moving on to the <strong>Grand Finals week</strong> , earning themselves a <strong>Top 3</strong> finish for the <strong>first time ever</strong> for <strong>Team Canada</strong>. <strong>Brazil</strong> will come up short, finishing in <strong>4th</strong>. <strong>But regardless of who wins or loses, this is one of those matches that you just can't help but to pay respect to every player who put their heart &amp; soul into this match.</strong></p>
