So what are Percy LNs exactly, and what effect do they have on osu!mania gameplay?",authors:["auxesiaa"],table_of_contents:!0},t=`<h1>Percy Long Notes (LNs)</h1>
<p>I’m sure everyone who has been around the mania scene for more than a few months has heard of Percy, and may even be using it. No, it is not a person. You may have also heard players call them “Percys”, “cut LN”, “Short LN”, “Cheat LN”, and many more. Hopefully by the end of all this you will have a clearer idea of what Percy LNs are and the impact they have on gameplay.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What exactly is a Percy LN?</h2>
<p>I would define Percy LNs as Long Notes, notes that you hold down and release at the end, with the visible end of the note ending much earlier than where it actually ends, thus making the long note seem shorter than it actually is. Some earlier variants of Percy skins used fading LN tails to create this effect, but with modern skinning techniques and experiments, other types of Percy LNs have been created.</p>
<p>They don’t make a big difference on low density maps, but on high density LN maps, Percy LNs make the map way more readable, and in some extreme cases, make super dense LN Wall patterns look just like a rice map. <a href="https://youtu.be/LES_3QJU3D4">This video</a> gives an accurate (though slightly exaggerated) example of Percy LNs in play compared to a normal LN.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How did it come to be?</h2>
<p>The origin of Percy LNs can be traced back to 2018, where a user by the name of <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9218461">Percyqaz</a> showcased an edit to his skin in his <a href="https://youtu.be/51N0zj-FKSk">YouTube Video</a>. It is also where the skin edit got it’s name “Percy”.</p>
<p>Initially, there weren’t many people who started using it as it was a rather niche concept at the time and all the top LN players at the time didn’t even bother with it. However, during the huge influx of players from 2020-2022, and the increasingly popular meta of Dan maps, players began to search for faster ways to improve at the game. In came Percy LNs.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have seen players take LN physicality beyond what was even considered playable a few years back. From the initial 3 clears on the 15th LN Dan ([Crz]Lochie, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Kn0p6fqUW4">Yeoul</a> and [Crz]Leaves_) in 2020 when the Dan was first released, where the 4th clear came quite some time later, to new players clearing the course almost every month now, Percy LNs have had some part to play in making this possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>So how does it work?</strong></h2>
<p>There are two main types of Percy LNs; the original fading LN tail and the newer “short” LN tail. The original fading LN tail is much simpler, as all you need to do is open the LN_Body sprite in an image editor, and using the fade tool, edit the image to make the end of the LN fade out instead of stopping at a hard point. A transparent LN tail image is also used in this variant.</p>
<p>Another type of cut LN is a more recent innovation, where instead of the tail fading out, you just have a LN body that is much shorter than the original length, and a transparent LN tail. How this works is by having a super long LN_Body sprite (like 40,000 pixels long), and a transparent LN tail sprite. As for the image of the LN_Body sprite, the end of the body will be the tail of the LN, which can be whatever shape and size you want it to be.</p>
<p>To prevent it from looking weird, a transparent LN tail is used so that it does not conflict with the very long body. By having such a long body, skinners take advantage of LN tail optimisation from the game’s engine, which makes the LN much shorter than it is supposed to be. This is more complicated, but ideal for players who want to use Percy LNs but cannot get used to fading LN tails.</p>
<p>There is a special case that needs to be addressed, however. It is where an LN does not use a super long sprite image, but instead uses a blank PNG or a tail with a bit of empty space after the LN tail ends, along with a normal LN body image. Strictly speaking, these do not qualify as Percy LNs, as the effect they have is minuscule compared to actual Percy LNs, and do not make the LN much shorter than it actually is.</p>
<p>Many skins use this type of LN, and chances are, the skin you are currently using will have this type of LN. Without it, you will have LN tails that connect to the head of the following note, making the skin much harder to read. An example of a skin with totally no empty transparent space behind the tail is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zjOW-lf4O86QC63UjR_ermD9GxtE1PM2/view?usp=sharing">Hibiki circle skin</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Is Percy LN a cheat?</h2>
<p>Short answer: <strong>No, it is not a cheating tool.</strong></p>
<p>Long Answer: Technically not. Although in the new upcoming LN dans, there is some speculation whether Percy skins may be used for a clear, Percy LN skins are not a third party program and are only a result of experimenting with skinning elements in game. As mentioned in the section before, Percy Lns are only a very long LN_Body sprite with a transparent tail, nothing in Percy LN skins is illegal and will not get you the ban hammer from peppy.</p>
<p>However, there exists a certain proportion of players who consider these cut LNs as a cheat, and should not be taken as playing LN maps legitimately. This has some ground to it as many players train for years to achieve a certain level of LN skill, only for them to be overtaken by a player who has only started playing LN for a few months with Percy LNs.</p>
<p>This is not a reason to consider Percy users illegitimate, nor as backing to initiate hostility to these players. It is merely a skinning trick that only affects the game visually, and does not alter the game’s mechanics. Although it does give players an edge, it is open for everyone to use.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>So how does it affect gameplay?</strong></h2>
<p>Numerous players have used Percys as a fast-track to being able to play dense LN maps. Most rice-focused players already have the physicality to play these LN maps, but just lack the reading capability. Normally, players read Density LNs by looking at the gap between the end of one tail and the head of one note, marking that as the point where they release the first note and hit the second note. So with Percy LNs shortening the LN tail visually, players are able to see the gap between notes much more clearly, therefore being able to read the map much better and getting higher scores than with normal LNs.</p>
<p>Because of Percy LNs, and the recent meta of ranked maps (especially farm maps) being more LN biassed in general, many players have flocked to integrating Percy LNs as part of their skin. The more famous users being Jakads and dressurf, who have broken the pp record numerous times with super dense LN farm maps since using Percy LNs, as well as the spike in players being able to clear the Yume Dan Course, the highest difficulty in the Underjoy LN Dans so far.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Do you need Percy LNs to be good at LNs?</h2>
<p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> As said many times before, they are merely a tool for you to improve your reading in dense LN maps. Many players in the past have achieved very high levels of play even before Percy LN was invented, and many still do now. Improving is merely a test of practice and patience. Even some of the best players, like cheewee10, have been playing LNs since 2015 to achieve their current level of play. Nobody can become a master overnight.</p>
<p>It is okay if you do not feel like learning how to play LNs, and don’t feel pressured by other players to learn LN. You are the captain of your own ship; you can play the game however you want to.</p>
<hr>
<h2>But what do top players think of this LN edit?</h2>
<p>I’m glad you asked. For this very specific reason, we invited the winner of the recently concluded osu!mania Long Note Tournament 3, <strong>Silhoueska Elze</strong> to share some of her thoughts on Percy LNs! Take it away Elze!</p>
<hr>
<h3>Silhoueska Elze</h3>
<p>Percy LNs are definitely interesting because they are different in the sense that the long note end is a lot lower than the next note. Great examples of skins like that would be Jakads’ and dressurf’s skin for 7K, and as for 4K, it would probably be something like Kibitz’s skin for the first variant of Percy, and CrewK’s skin for the more recently created variant.</p>
<p>For me, complaining about Percy skins are a waste of time, especially considering that it does not affect YOU as a player, and at the end of the day, they’re just using a way to be able to read long notes better. I mean, isn’t that the point of the whole thing, to find a way to get better in the first place? It’s not even like the players just instantly get better, I think that it still takes a lot of work to be able to improve your long note skill, especially in a tournament context. Sure, you may be able to read more difficult LNs; however, you’d still have to re-orient yourself to be able to play release-oriented maps like Encryption (Davvy), as they really require you to focus both on longer LNs and shorter LNs.</p>
<p>As a non-Percy user that’s attempted to play some skins with Percy in the past, I can say that adapting to this kind of skin is certainly no easy feat. You’d still have to get used to the LNs being more short than usual, which could definitely hinder your progress on the more release-oriented maps.</p>
<p>I think a great example of this is SuddenDeath. He is a player that never exactly falls off; however, his weaknesses on early and mid-game long-notes compared to other top players who have reached that level of physicality (i.e. comparing SuddenDeath to someone like cheewee10/[GS]Myuka) could certainly be seen. As far as I know, his latest skin is a sort of Percy that utilises a very thin but super long LN body.</p>
<p>However, it’s certainly possible to get good at LN accuracy as well in the process, and I think players like MIkuaimbot, CrewK, Poca are prime examples of it being possible.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thank you Elze for your very insightful thoughts! Elze has already cemented herself as one of the best LN players of this era, and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon! We hope that you continue to be an inspiration to all!</p>
<p>We have also managed to track down another LN prodigy and had them express their opinion on these cut LN edits. Within less than 2 years of joining the game, this player has already blown many long-standing LN accuracy scores out of their league, and has improved their overall skill dramatically! Please welcome MIkuaimbot!</p>
<hr>
<h3>MIkuaimbot</h3>
<p>For me, Percy LNs helped me a lot in term of reading when it comes to very dense LN maps that I cannot read well with normal LN notes, even though I used normal LN notes for a very long time before only switching to Percy LN recently. But, I think for people who have the issue where you release the LN very late, Percy LNs can fix this problem very quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>In my opinion, whether you should use Percy LNs or not, is dependent on each player’s preferences for accuracy. if you have a problem of releasing early I would suggest to use normal LNs because if you use Percy, you will just keep releasing earlier. But as I’m sure people have said before, Percy LNs can really boost your reading skill, and once you get used to it you will be able to play LN maps that you couldn’t before. It took me a while to get used to Percy LN, but after I got used to it I experienced a significant boost in my reading skill, although my accuracy has suffered a little bit.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thank you MIkuaimbot for your short and concise points! We wish you all the best on your journey as one of the most talented players to spawn in the past two years!</p>
<p>And finally, we have managed to get ahold of one of the most well known LN players still kicking around today! Dominating the LN scene since 2018, winning numerous tournaments along the way, and having the most tournament badges out of any mania player, please welcome the one and only cheewee10!</p>

<p>Well, for 4k, Percy only actually helps when the map is hard to a point where it doesn't have any pure LN elements in it anymore, I'd say maybe Yami+? At that point I don’t think you're even playing &quot;LNs&quot; anymore, it does help with reading for dense stuff but its justifiable because of super dense LNs just being rice patterns. On the other hand, it has tons of drawbacks for maps that are on the easier side/release oriented, and definitely isn't ideal for tournaments if you wanna go for LN acc. Its doable if the player adapts to Percy very well, but so far i think there's very few people who have done so.</p>
<p>Percy in 7k on the other hand, I believe it helps a lot in terms of reading, no matter how easy the map is since 7k requires more reading capability compared to 4k, and Percy can definitely help in that aspect. But it shouldn't be used by players that are new to 7k, as they should build up their reading skills to a certain point, and only then use Percy to further boost their reading skills to another level.</p>
<p>When it comes to tournaments, I'm sure almost every player would prefer Percy 7k LNs when it comes to really hard maps. I don’t think anyone would disagree with me on that. On another note, it depends on how the player adapts to Percy 7k LN acc. Some are able to adapt extremely well (eg. Liangiaiajan) and some just find a hard time with finding the right timing to get good LN acc. All in all, 7k Percy is more widely used than 4k Percy as it is more useful/flexible in various scenarios (eg. tournament play, farming #1 on leaderboards, getting a raw skillboost) while compared to 4k Percy which only provides better reading for stuff that are 14dan+ (Yami+)</p>
<hr>
<p>Thank you cheewee10 for your very well-placed words! We hope that you will continue to dominate the LN scene in both 4k and 7k, and best of luck in the upcoming 7 Key Mania World Cup!</p>
<p>That is all from our interview section with some of the best players around!</p>

<h2><strong>Cons of using Percy LNs</strong></h2>
<p>Everything said so far has all been showing the benefits of using Percy LNs. But as expected, there is always a flip side.</p>
<p>To get started, Percy LNs make the LN shorter than it is supposed to, which helps with reading but compromises your accuracy. Most LN accuracy players judge where to release the LN by the end of the tail. So if the tail on a Percy is not the actual end of the LN, then players will experience a situation where they release the LN too early, resulting in bad accuracy.</p>
<p>This is something players can get used to, however. As pointed out by Elze earlier, some of the best LN players use Percy LNs and still obtain very good accuracies on insanely difficult maps. But for players just starting out, getting good accuracy on LN oriented maps with Percy will prove to be slightly more difficult.</p>
<p>The next downside of using Percy LNs is that players will become reliant on them. Now, there is nothing wrong with using Percys, however, after using them for so long, it will be difficult to swap back to normal LN tails, as you are already used to releasing the LN slightly later than the visual end of the LN. This needs some further adjusting, and at the end of it all, you will experience a decreased LN reading ability, along with just feeling uncomfortable releasing LNs at where they are supposed to be released. Again, this can be fixed with time, and most players who use Percy will never go back to using normal LNs.</p>
<p>However, closely following the second point, we have the third issue with Percy LNs; LN splitting. This is a more technical issue than a player issue. The reason why Percy LNs are so long is to try and minimise LN splitting. What is LN splitting? It is when a LN suddenly splits visually but not mechanically. <a href="https://youtu.be/WzuX8Q_rIrw?t=9">Something like this.</a> It happens because the LN body repeats itself after it has gone through the height of the image. So to compensate, Percy LNs use super tall bodies to minimise the chances of this happening, but it is not perfect. Although nowadays skins are able to avoid this issue, it does happen from time to time, and may result in a player losing a run because of that.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion (TL:DR)</h2>
<p>Percy LNs are sprites in game that make LNs much easier to read, and as a result make dense LN charts more playable than they should be. This has resulted in many new unforeseen scores being set, but some players question the eligibility of this skin edit that gives such a huge advantage to players who use them. However, they are not a cheat mechanic and are not ban-worthy, nor should they be considered cheating or having an unfair advantage as anyone can download a Percy skin and use it.</p>
<p>Percy LNs have revolutionised high level LN gameplay, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. I hope this article has helped you understand what a Percy LN is, and how it can change the way LNs are played.</p>
<p>Percy Lns may be a scourge for original LN enthusiasts, but at the same time, they are a long awaited blessing for all players looking to improve at LN.</p>
