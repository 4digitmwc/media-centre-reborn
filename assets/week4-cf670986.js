<p><strong>So obviously, not the best way to leave 4dmwc. But before we get into &quot;that&quot; moment, you guys were down 5-0 against Japan. While the SV picks are almost a gimme, you guys were struggling with the rice maps. What happened?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Johnney101</strong>: Well I fingerlocked alot, the nerves hit me real bad, and I feel like I have to match up to the other players of the team so I try and play as perfect as possible but I guess it backfired</p>
<p><strong>NeonDrakon</strong>: For me at least it was a combination of being slightly tired from playing somewhat early, and in general being quite nervous.</p>
<p><strong>diamondBlaze</strong>: In Smash Bros. when people make a bad excuse for losing it's called a &quot;john&quot;. My John is that I've never woken up for a match at 11AM before x). Still glad I could mostly FC. I guess that's a thing you can learn from</p>
<p><strong>Oliverq</strong>: Yea it was weird having a tournament first thing in the morning but nervs and Japan just being very good is a big part of it.</p>
<p><strong>So then, you guys managed to come back to make it a 3-0 run. I was wondering what changed or sparked you guys to go make it a 2 point game after the 8th map?</strong></p>
<p><strong>diamondBlaze</strong>: The 8th map? Hang on. (10 seconds later) ohhhhh I get what you mean now.</p>
<p><strong>Johnney101</strong>: Well on rice I played it like a casual map, so I didn’t think of playing perfectly, which helped me play a bit better to not fingerlock as much. I thought we fully lost at that point.</p>
<p><strong>NeonDrakon</strong>: I think that we had a couple of our stronger maps left as well as oliver and diamond absolutely clutching on LN3.</p>
<p><strong>diamondBlaze</strong>: It was a surprise, honestly. Me FCing New Genesis after having 940k PB on it did give a bit of motivation (and oliver's really good score too), but we were still crazy nervous… What helped me was just thinking of it as a chance to show off rather than life-or-death, as a natural showoff person LOL</p>
<p><strong>Oliverq</strong>: For me what helps a lot is kind of zoning out and not thinking about it being a tournament like I'm just calmly playing a map in solo. On LN3, I also was actually kinda in line with the timing instead of being way to late or way too early like I normally am with LN.</p>
<p><strong>diamondBlaze</strong>: Yeah you’re an LN God now.</p>
<p><strong>Oliverq</strong>: You guys still got better scores lol</p>
<p><strong>diamondBlaze</strong>: Not on LN3 FeelsStrongMan</p>
<p><strong>Alrighty. Now to Amazing Mirage. diamondBlaze, this is pretty much for you: What happened on that play? It looked like you were experiencing technical issues with the map. And to everyone else, had diamondBlaze never had his issues, did you guys think you were going to win on HB2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>diamondBlaze</strong>: Right so I play on a membrane keyboard (attached to my laptop), mostly because it feels nicer for me to play acc on. The laptop I have isn't like.. perfect though, so sometimes it registers keytaps 40ish ms late (free 200), and on rare occasions it doesn't register anything for ~1 second. Most of the time it's not that bad but... yeah it didn't make me happy there LOL. But life goes on.</p>
<p><strong>NeonDrakon</strong>: I would think we had about a 30% chance on it without hardware issues. Far from a guaranteed point for Japan but certainly favoured for them.</p>
<p><strong>diamondBlaze</strong>: Also: that map is cursed, Netherlands had hardware issues on it when we played them so maybe it was karma.</p>
<p><strong>NeonDrakon</strong>: True dat.</p>
<p><strong>I know it sucks that Sweden is eliminated from 4DMWC. But I want to ask how you guys feel about your performances in the past month? Did you guys feel satisfied or disappointed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Johnney101</strong>: Personally, I feel disappointed in myself. As I'm suffering from third player syndrome, I keep thinking to myself that I'm dragging down every team score. It kind of unmotivates me to keep going. I play amazing off tournament, but the second the matches start, I throw for the whole team.</p>
<p><strong>Oliverq</strong>: I feel a similar way. Tournament was very fun and I love the team but I feel like I should have improve more to not drag the team down and those matches against Japan and France could have gone better.</p>
<p><strong>NeonDrakon</strong>: Yeah it always sucks to be knocked out, but frankly I'm super satisfied with this year overall. Especially after the win against the Netherlands which is one time I've felt the most nervous during a match as well as satisfied once the final results screen finally revealed itself!</p>
<p><em>(also being knocked out this round instead of the next prevented me from inevitably throwing every map once my skill cap kicks in :p )</em></p>
<p><strong>diamondBlaze</strong>: Perfectly alright with it tbh! 13th is our best by one round but I feel like we're a lot better skillwise, particularly in the balance between rice and LN. There's no use being sad when the odds are kind of against you</p>
<p><em>(Also neon is lying he's a god)</em></p>
<p><strong>Were there any supporters from Sweden that was cheering you guys on? And if so, what is the future of Sweden in 4DMWC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>diamondBlaze</strong>: I mean we're gonna keep fighting the good fight, most of all, I think we as a team can still do a lot more things. But having 6 people would also be nice.</p>
<p><strong>NeonDrakon</strong>: I know the Swedish VSRG server was watching from the sidelines, as well as a couple of other friends from within the community! And next year I'm gonna try to be a bit more aggressive and early with asking people to join!</p>
<p><em>(also hoping not too many of us from this year get skill banned haha)</em></p>
<p><strong>diamondBlaze</strong>: Yeah neon and i are like on the verge monkaS</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<p><strong>Congratulations on your victory against Sweden! I want to hear your thoughts on how the match happened for you guys?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>スウェーデン戦の勝利、おめでとうございます 試合の感想を聞きたいのですが、皆さんにとってどのような試合だったのでしょうか？</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>AxReo</strong>: Tbh I thought my opponent was better than me so we can make my first break and the game had a good flow!</p>
<p>(and... sweden team member is so cute lol we love them lmfao)</p>
<p><em>正直相手の方が上手だと思っていたので最初にブレイクできていい流れができたのでいい試合だったと思います！！</em></p>
<p><em>(あとスウェーデンの方々がとてもかわいかったです笑)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mi0117</strong>: It was a fun match to fight, although it was a series of unexpected events.</p>
<p><em>予想外の連続でしたが、戦っていて楽しい試合でした</em></p>
<p><strong>Ageha8239</strong>: To be honest, when I watched the match on Saturday, I personally did not feel like I could win.　I was very happy that I was able to follow through and enjoy the game, even though I was nervous about it.</p>
<p><em>正直土曜日にあった試合を見ていて、勝てる気は個人的にあんまりなかったです。　本番自分が緊張してしまうのも全部フォローしてもらってとても助けてもらって楽しませてもらってます。</em></p>
<p><strong>Syo73</strong>: I was the only Japanese player who also played last year, so I was happy to be able to play against Sweden again! Like last year, it was not an easy match. But I was not worried because of the great play of my teammates.</p>
<p><em>僕は去年も出ているただ一人の日本の選手だったので、またスウェーデンと試合をすることができて嬉しかったです。
去年と同様、簡単な試合ではありませんでした。
しかし、味方の素晴らしいプレイがあるので心配はしていませんでした。</em></p>
<p><strong>yakik</strong>: I think we were able to win thanks to our team members. During the game, we gave our opponents We lost a goal, but we encouraged each other and kept good condition.</p>
<p><em>チームメンバーのおかげで勝つことができたと思います。試合中、相手に 失点してしまいましたが、お互いに励まし合い、良いコンディションを保つことができました。</em></p>
<p><strong>You guys started off on a 5-0 run, but then Japan lost the next 3 maps. Just as when Sweden was almost able to force Tiebreaker, you guys took your last point on Hybrid 2 (HB2). How did you guys feel during that time when Sweden almost come back? I did research before this match and Sweden had better scores than Japan before your match happened.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>あなたたちは5-0でスタートしましたが、その後の3マップは日本が負けてしまいました。スウェーデンがタイブレークに持ち込もうとしたときと同じように、あなたたちはハイブリッド2（HB2）で最後のポイントを取りました。スウェーデンに逆転されそうになった時、皆さんはどう感じましたか？この試合の前に調べたのですが、この試合が行われる前はスウェーデンの方が日本よりスコアが良かったんですよね。</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>AxReo</strong>: our captain(mi) threw his faith in our team haha</p>
<p>and we had the most hope in the HB...</p>
<p>(We thought that Sweden can get point in RC)</p>
<p><em>キャプテンが私たちを信じて投げました</em></p>
<p><em>あとHBがいちばん希望があったので...</em></p>
<p><em>ライスは多分相手が取ってしまうし...</em></p>
<p><strong>Syo73</strong>: I was amazed at Sweden's underlying strength...</p>
<p>The remaining maps could have been taken by either side, so I felt that all I had to do was to trust my friends!</p>
<p><em>スウェーデンの底力に驚かされました・・</em></p>
<p><em>残っていた譜面はどちらが取ってもおかしくないものだったので、あとは仲間を信じるだけだと感じました</em></p>
<p><strong>Mi0117, this is for you. I noticed during the match, you switched with Ageha8239 on RC 3 &amp; RC 2. Was this strategy suppose to throw off Sweden or was it because you think you can do better in competition?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Mi0117さん、これです。試合中、RC3とRC2でアゲハ8239と交代していましたが、これはスウェーデンを突き放すための作戦なのでしょうか、それとも対戦ではもっとうまくやれると思っているからなのでしょうか？</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Mi0117</strong>: I was practicing today RC and got about 180,000 points up, so I decided to do</p>
<p><em>今日練習してたら18万点くらい伸びたので出ることにしました。</em></p>
<p><strong>Ah! so you improved very fast! Amazing!</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>あ！上達が早かったんですね。すごい！</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Mi0117</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>You guys are facing against either America or Singapore in the Loser's Semifinals. What is Japan's strategy heading into next week? Is there a long term goal you guys want to do for 4DMWC?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>敗者復活戦の相手は、アメリカかシンガポールです。来週に向けた日本の戦略は？また、4DMWCに向けて、長期的な目標があれば教えてください。</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Mi0117</strong>: Whichever way we hit we must win by using advantage of Japan strengths!! Our goal is to become famous not as SV Country but as 4DM Country haha</p>
<p><em>どちらに当たっても日本の強みを生かして勝っていきます。目標はSVカントリーではなく4DMカントリーとして有名になれたら嬉しいです。</em></p>
<p><strong>Syo73</strong>: This is our consensus.</p>
<h2>Brazil</h2>
<p><strong>So congratulations on your victory against Malaysia! Can I get your guys thoughts on this match?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nayeonie bunny</strong>: This was the round that got me the most nervous, I got to miss a few times because of that. Besides being the first tournament I play in my life.</p>
<p><strong>Buvuw</strong>: I was kinda scared of Malaysia ngl, but at the time of the match I was confident because my warmup was like really really strong.</p>
<p><strong>Soore</strong>: I was confident even though nerves were getting in the way so much, for me it meant a lot to beat Malaysia, because we were eliminated by them in the 4DMWC in the third edition (2021).</p>
<p><strong>Zergh</strong>: It was definitely our hardest match so far, got me shaking after the third map and we were ready to get close scores as we did. Thankfully our team got the consistency blessings today and we were able to secure the win! The 6-2 was definitely not as easy as it can seem like.</p>
<p><strong>So for Zergh &amp; Maykee kee, you guys are back after 4DMWC 2022. How is this team different compared to the team Brazil was last year?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zergh</strong>: Well i think the biggest difference this year is that we have more great mid-late game players who can have a reasonable early acc instead of a strong early-mid game with one late rice and one late ln specialist. Also, our sv for the first time is not as strong as it used to be but it's not bad, we can play and we are practicing it, we just need to get over tournament nerves xD. Not to mention scheduling is soooo much easier without 2 players living in Japan XDDD (soutin e terror ❤️)</p>
<p><strong>Maykee kee</strong>: Buvuw and nayeon are more strong than the last year team</p>
<p><strong>So you guys will be back in Winner's SFs just like last year. You guys will be facing against the #2 seed China. Any preparations for that match?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Buvuw</strong>: I don't know actually, maybe playing the SVs a lot more</p>
<p><strong>Zergh</strong>: Yes, this will be a strong training and pushing week as the mappool is not easy and the Chinese team has proven they have a strong well rounded team.  We wanna make sure we'll be at our best to face them and I'm quite confident in my teammates :)</p>
<p><strong>Maykee kee</strong>: I will just play harder maps everyday. But I need to train my acc…</p>
<p><strong>Do you guys see Brazil being back in Top 3 for the first time since 2021?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Buvuw</strong>: ABSOLUTELY</p>
<p><strong>Maykee kee</strong>: No. I don’t remember…</p>
<p><strong>Soore</strong>: Surely.</p>
<p><strong>Buvuw</strong>: Nah we winning this bruh.</p>
<p><strong>Zergh</strong>: Oh for sure, that is our goal and we will not be happy otherwise. Although I didn't joined the team at the 2021 edition, their bittersweet sentiment getting the 3rd position definitely passed on to me</p>
