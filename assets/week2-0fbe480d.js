<p><strong>Hello again, Philippine Team and welcome to the interview! It's been a while! I just want to ask about your match with Japan in Round of 32 and some of your strategies within the round.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First, I believe you banned SV against Japan and it was shocking that one of your players played Fade In for the other SV pick, what is the idea/context behind that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>ManiaDegenGod</strong>: Derp should answer this lols</p>
<p><strong>Dyei</strong>: flexing daw (it was a flex) HAHAHAHAHAHA</p>
<p><strong>arccat</strong>: oh my god HAHAHAHAHHAHA</p>
<p><strong>Dyei</strong>: such a formal interview</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA</p>
<p><strong>ManiaDegenGod</strong>: because fade in with sv is very good strat, (it) makes reading easier</p>
<p><strong>From the sheets and the initial planning, was derp actually the one that should play or was there a problem?</strong></p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: :sob:</p>
<p><strong>dyei</strong>: HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: actually there was no problem, it's just surprising i read it easier the way it is than without fade in. because I was playing the sv1, there's some significant change when i played with fade in one time. I even got a personal best around 965k. I did it with sv2, did well also so I played with fade in now, but also with that incentive as a &quot;flex&quot; as some players would call on a tournament stage (if you know what I mean). I choked because of technical issues, nothing else. but it went consistent the whole map until the end (kind of a reverse choke)</p>
<p><strong>So, that one was an actual intention of &quot;reading better&quot;? I see! That's a good strategy honestly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next question! For everyone!</strong></p>
<p><strong>You have a triple V1 SS on Heavenly Spores which is a extremely good showing of team consistency but surprisingly still lost by 589 points due to ratio battle, what happened in that moment? Were there nerves and things like that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: I agree that we had a really good team score on Heavenly Spores. From what I saw, I think tenshi was a bit nervous during the start of the match. But I think it'd be better if he were to state his POV</p>
<p><strong>Tenshi</strong>: ah, i regret streaming</p>
<p><strong>arccat</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>Tenshi</strong>: it affected my ratio consistency</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: We did a triple v1ss on rice 2 which is heavenly spores makes us very proud on how we managed to even got it honestly, but due to having an unfortunate fate that we cannot beat their ratio regardless of the v1ss we had, which is also due to my behalf didn't reach that 995k par score and also Tenshi underperforming based on technicality issues. Regardless of what happened, we're glad that we're having that work that makes us feel proud somehow even if that score goes to japan.</p>
<p><strong>arccat</strong>: I see! I guess it's more of a technical issue than that of a personal issue? To follow up, what can you guys do to lessen these scenarios happening again?</p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: In my opinion, I think we could've focused a bit more on the match</p>
<p><strong>Tenshi</strong>: I usually remove some of my running programs which I tend to fail during the match.</p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: Yeah, I've also made a habit of this for the past year.</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: I guess be prepared more to avoid on that happening by prepping the computer and avoid running applications on idle while on match</p>
<p><strong>JANKY INTERVIEW QUESTION. There's several versions of adobo, right? Which one do you think is the best version? Saucy? Creamy? Dried?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dyei</strong>: saucy</p>
<p><strong>Tenshi</strong>: saucy supremacy</p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: I like saucy adobo</p>
<p><strong>DiamondGenius75</strong>: I like it very salty, thick, and hot. I like it when it's freshly cooked by my dad as well, though at first it might be stinky but it's actually very delicious</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: i like creamy adobo</p>
<p><strong>arccat</strong>: STINKY??????? DIAMOND EXPLAIN</p>
<p><strong>dyei</strong>: diamond's dad probably put durian on their adobo</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: it creates that thick and creamy consistency when you pour on rice,, with that salty and sour with creamy components,, mmfghn........</p>
<p><strong>arccat</strong>: no shot :sob:</p>
<p><strong>ManiaDegenGod</strong>: Saucy for the rice</p>
<p><strong>dyei</strong>: (1)</p>
<p><strong>Okay! Back to the actual questions. The round was basically LN vs Rice battle until the very end, winning Hotel Moonside with an impressive 995-995-994 team score to force tiebreaker against Japan, what were your reactions on pulling that insane team consistency?</strong></p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: Honestly,, I slayed no joke. Btw, it was a sightread and yes, haven't played that ever</p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: To be honest, I was not surprised. I knew those two were able to pull off scores like those.</p>
<p><strong>Tenshi</strong>: good thing I gave the Hybrid spot to derp.</p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: but still, I was so happy when we won that pick. I literally screamed.</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: it’s surprising to me because I didn't know what my score could be…</p>
<p><strong>Would you say that it's actually a sightread buff?</strong></p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: I'd say, it is… because the very important thing is to play the map as accurate as possible and I somehow did it without the idea on what's happening inside the patterns of the map.</p>
<p><strong>Vermifilo</strong>: Late reply, Confident we would win that. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Amazing! I guess that answers that everyone should sightread the pools! ((Please don't)) Next up... Oh yeah! Congrats on the win by the way, though you got into a tiebreaker and from a different perspective, that's a sign of early game struggle. How do you think the strategies you've mentioned for this round will change in the later stages?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: I think that in later stages, we'll be able to integrate more of our &quot;unga bunga&quot; strat considering that we have four rice powerhouses</p>
<p><strong>arccat</strong>: THE MONKEY IS REAL</p>
<p><strong>DiamondGenius75</strong>: unga bunga strat :moyai:</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: it'll change drastically in my perspective; as the opponents goes stronger and we need to change strategies, plans, and map pickings, how we play and who will play those maps…</p>
<p><strong>Tenshi</strong> — For me, I prefer not getting pressured and focus more on maps that can improve my skill.</p>
<p><strong>DiamondGenius75</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1050992500950708385/1068221713952809030/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>What kind of changes you think will happen if 2 of the powerhouses was unable to perform on any day? Would you panic or feel hopeless?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: It's unavoidable to panic, even just a little. The best we can do is adapt.</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: I'd say we give it another shot of hope somehow</p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: We’d just change our strategy based off of the remaining players</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: there's no such thing as being hopeless on a thing you're very hopeful to win it or get it</p>
<p><strong>arccat</strong>: That's true.</p>
<p><strong>Tenshi</strong>: As one of the Rice and SV powerhouses (got to include this bruh), I think the best thing to do is to use Plan B.</p>
<p><strong>Okay! I think the media centre has run out of bullets- I mean questions. One last thing! You're facing Hong Kong this Ro16 and possibly facing Canada, France, Ireland, or Vietnam by Quarterfinals. Do you have any message for any of these countries?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dyei</strong>: please be gentle</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: choke me daddy AHAHAHHAHAHAH</p>
<p><strong>arccat</strong>: SUSSY</p>
<p><strong>Tenshi</strong>: Be weary of what’s going to come.</p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: I'm excited to face off against the new Hong Kong! Please remember that we won't be going down without a fight, and that we're in this to win the whole thing. For Canada, France, Ireland, and Vietnam, let's all have fun!</p>
<p><strong>iid3rp</strong>: I'd say, good luck and we hope that we can make this tournament the most of it because we're glad to even qualify on 4dm at the very first place</p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: Raiden dies.</p>
<p><strong>Dyei</strong>: facing these teams is going to be a hard fight but don’t even try to underestimate the PH team, yes early game is probably our weakness, but we are still improving and like Frossno, our team captain said, we are not going down without a fight. (the audacity for me to say &quot;we&quot; but most likely I’m still not going to play because my acc is bad)</p>
<p><strong>Alright! This sums up the whole interview, thank you so much for answering! Good bye and see you in space!</strong></p>
<p><strong>dyei</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Frossno</strong>: Take you, Arccat!</p>

<h2>Thailand (nanonbandusty)</h2>
<p><strong>Firstly, congratulations for the win against Chile! I'm pretty sure it is a really good start for Thailand Team here. Are you satisfied with your win, or a performance of the team so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>nanonbandusty</strong>: I think my team right now is quite balance through out every stage of the game, but the only issue is that our Ln score gap between third and second player is significantly noticeable which the problem will probably solve with time and practice.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting to hear that, we've heard about the Noodle Legend of Thailand Team as well so we are looking forward to see the incredible Noodle Consuming performance from you all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyway, how do you guys plan, practice and prepare the team for this tournament?</strong></p>
<p><strong>nanonbandusty</strong>: Currently Since our Ln players are not that well-balanced yet, we should be taking some player to mainly focusing on improving their Ln skills.</p>
<p><strong>Glad that you all are trying to improve! For the next match, you will be facing USA and I've heard about the unstoppable will to defeat them as well. What are you looking forward to in the next match?</strong></p>
<p>I'm hoping that the match will be intense, but I don't feel like we are losing because we got the
<strong>4DM5 Thailand Propaganda</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Let those North-South Americans know about it!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;3hr. per day / 6hr. per weekday&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Spam Tiebreaker&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Practice Early Game ACC NOW!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Snipe Brazil and USA that are in Recent Ranked / Qualified Leaderboard&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Protecc LN Release Late Game&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Spam MWC Map With ScoreV2&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Believe in the propaganda! What is your expectation of the team, or the tournament overall?</strong></p>
<p>My expectation here for this tournament is firstly, beat USA then all I want is to have a close match against Singapore or maybe even win (I wish)</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, someone asked me to ask you about the Tom Yam Koong Recipe. Would you mind sharing one?</strong></p>
<p>Personally, I don't cook, but if I need to tell the recipe for tom yam kung it would be simply using the seasoning package from the nissin instant noodle tom yam kung flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for participating the interview with us! And I hope to see you at the top as well! May the propaganda be with you!</strong></p>

<h2>Poland</h2>
<p><strong>First off, congratulations on your win against Mexico, the higher seeded in your bout of the Round of 32! It was a well fought battle, with your team emerging victorious from the frantic back-and-forth with a 5-2 win. How do you feel about the successful seed upset? Did you feel there were any important factors leading to the success?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoweR_LendzeR:</strong> I felt great but there was nothing special (about the upset). Mexico just made too many mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>SitekX:</strong> Thanks! As expected our match was pretty rough and hard. It proves that we have really promising new generation of tournament players (MemePaladin339, Paraxia and bagjettka) with different skillsets. Looking on our seeds, this seed upset technicaly was the easiest to get and to be honest I didn't care about this factor too much. We and Mexico are teams with different strengths and weaknesses. However this time the most important thing that led us to win was our consistency which was better than Mexico's, without that we could easily lose because of their better accuracy, especially on LN and SV maps.</p>
<p><strong>Paraxia:</strong> Thank you! To be honest I wasn't expecting it to be such a rough match, but we managed to prove that it's not a problem for us! I'm pretty sure it would be an even harder match if not the fact that Mexico just wasn't in a really good condition and their team was making too much mistakes. I also think that our consistency mostly led us to victory.</p>
<p><strong>MemePaladin399:</strong> Thanks, and I feel good about it. As for the important factors it's pretty much what others said already - Mexico's misses which really dropped their score, but even without that I think we still could've won, but that would entirely depend on which maps would've been picked sooner.</p>
<p><strong>The team composition of Poland seems to be rather interesting this year, featuring fresh new faces to the international scene, as well as players who came from previous iterations of MWC and 4DM -- How does the team coordinate with one another and how do your strategies work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoweR_LendzeR:</strong> From my side I don't see any strategy except selecting players by the best personal scores and picking maps by seed (yeah, it will be rly good strategy Vs Singapore). Our coordination... we don't have time in our private life to have it properly. results sent the day before the match, no planning who is supposed to improve something and what is not worth playing for him. currently we have a week of silence on discord xD However, what I like the most is the teamwork before and during the match. everything is happening very quickly, but the guys get it and it's great!</p>
<p><strong>SitekX:</strong> It's really fun to cooperate with new players and play with them together in a tournament, especially when they are probably younger than me by 10 years or even more. It's also satisfying that I can give them some tips and then being beat by them. From my side it also give me motivation to play on tournaments again just like few years ago. About our strategies: we are just sitting on discord's voice channel analizing our and opponent scores, and then deciding how do we feel right now on playing choosen maps.</p>
<p><strong>Paraxia:</strong> Well, it's actually my first time playing in a tournament like this, but it seems like we're coordinating pretty well! Just like Sitek Said, our strategy is analizing our and opponent's scores, and then deciding on who is playing on choosen maps (maybe except of that one time on the SV2 pick when we had to abort the match just because we changed our minds on the last second...)</p>
<p><strong>MemePaladin399:</strong> We pretty much just compare our best scores and based on that we choose who will play what maps and that happens either on the day of our match or just moments before it, it's a bit chaotic I'd say.</p>
<p><strong>Is the team satisfied with their performance in the tournament by far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoweR_LendzeR:</strong> Yes. Everyone felt that dose of dopamine after win that we forgot that our next opponent is seed #1 and we were writing each other that no one can beat us xD</p>
<p><strong>SitekX:</strong> I guess we are satisfied - comparing to last year qualifications it's a good improvement (from #22 to #17), but to be honest we could do a bit better. We are much more satisfied about won over Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Paraxia:</strong> I'm honestly pretty satisfied! We all played pretty well in our match with Mexico, but as Sitek stated, I also think we could do a little bit better.</p>
<p><strong>MemePaladin399:</strong> We did good enough to progress into the next stage so I'd say we're satisfied with it, but of course there's always some room for improvement like others said.</p>
<p><strong>Crazy enough as it seems, your team will be squaring off against the 1st seeded Singapore. Are there any changes and improvements your team might want to make relative to past performances? Do you want to say anything to Singapore and the other teams playing in 4DM?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PoweR_LendzeR:</strong> On my opinion Polish players need to increase their willingness to play SV and LN maps. And finally, &quot;Tanio skóry nie sprzedam&quot; ~Mariusz Pudzianowski (we won't give up that easily). Have fun and don't get upset after losing. Taking part in such a tournament already shows what level you are at!</p>
<p><strong>SitekX:</strong> I hope we will be able to get some points from them. As in Ro32 match against Mexico, the most important factor for us is our consistency which will be the key. We know that winning seems almost impossible, but the chances are never 0%! After match against Mexico we know better our strengths and we will try to maximize our potencial against that hard opponent. I believe we can surprise them and the audience. Poland is known for really good SV skills, but sadly its not true anymore probably. What I want to tell all teams in 4DM is just to enjoy your matches and never give up!</p>
<p><strong>Paraxia:</strong> Not gonna lie, all of us in the team are pretty negative about our match with Singapore, but we still won't give up that easily. All I wanna say to Singapore is that I wish them the best of luck in our match!</p>
<p><strong>MemePaladin399:</strong> I'm not really sure about that one, I guess we'll just do our best which is honestly all we can go for, considering we're playing against Singapore our chances of winning are rather slim, but despite that we won't give up. What I want to say to everyone playing is just good luck and have fun.</p>
