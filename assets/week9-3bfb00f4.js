<p><strong>HowToPlayLN</strong> As we finished Essence faster than expected, which is before the tournament started, we decided to came up with the ideas of making an <strong>EP (Extended Play)</strong> based on the variation theme of 1547, starting from the initial lore which was written by <strong>Polytetral</strong>, where I actually decided to write a continuation in my POV after finishing the ETI Model. The first song that originated the idea of making an EP is <strong>wandering through the stars</strong>, which was later used in the RO32 cutscene. Poly also came up with the idea of making the videos, based on the lore we have planned and wrote, and I as well decided to join by asking takehirotei if we can make a full album out of this variation theme, and everything was started from there.</p>
<p>This album, however, started with the dark/horror theme, as well as provided an empty feeling and represented the anger and apocalypse at the first half, continued with despair and chaos before the hope and determination, to build up to the <strong>Essence</strong>. It was of course a really emotional ride from the start to an end. As the lore also mentioned about <strong>LNCryption</strong>, which was the osu!mania LN Tournament 3 lore as a prequel, or the parallel to this universe, this was also the concept to bring from the dark and dissonant theme to more promising ending. There was actually a few references from <strong>LNCryption</strong> in this track which we will dive down in this article.</p>
<h2>Compositions</h2>
<h3>Lost in Space (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>So this is where everything was started, the little story here is that Poly made the trailer for 4 Digit MWC 2023, but the trailer music contained watermark (a tts said <em>“an audio”</em>). So I decided to create a brand new trailer music especially for this video.</p>
<p>When this composition was made, <strong>Essence</strong> was already made to the first drop. We decided to borrow the motif from Essence (1547) for this track, combining with strings ensemble and piano arpeggios.</p>
<h3>monochroma. (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>For monochroma, the music was made after the lore about the death of Polychroma. The concept was to emphasize the word <strong>infinity</strong> which is mentioned in a lore, combining the repeating 12-tone technique, and usage of Cello to make it feel more like space horror theme. There is not much detail on this for this one, except the fact that it has the tonal feelings even there was the usage of atonality in the track.</p>
<p>The track name also came from the antonym of the word <em>polychroma</em>, as it was the loss of polychroma, and the lost of index's ability to see the colors.</p>
<h3>wandering through the stars (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>It was the second 4 Digit MWC 2023 original song that was finished, consists of the piano, and string quartet. For the piano intro, I just accidentally created the <strong>musical illusion!</strong> When there are two high melodies played at the same time, it created the illusion that the brain could not distinguish which one is the main melody, or both can be the main melody at the same time without clashing each other.</p>
<p>Here comes the <strong>cello and violin pizzicato</strong> next, this creates the low and mid voice in contrast with the piano which is the high voice, the usage of pizzicato also gives the emptiness feeling to the song. After that, we introduced the double violin + viola arco to progress from the emptiness (but the melody still makes it feel empty).</p>
<p>The second part was piano staccato solo at high voice and cello at the low voice, creating the contrast, as well as piano is constantly giving the emptiness feelings through the high voice before the string ensemble fills up at the end, ending with the slowed piano solo at the ending.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this track was the best I could pull off for my take on the Piano + String Quartet arrangement, both harmony choices, progression throughout the song, call-and-response technique, usage of the tension and releases and more.</p>
<h3>Polychromatic Dissociation (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>There was a funny story about this, that the first half of this song was composed while I was with my irl friends and we had some alcohols before I composed this. I blasted out the 7/8 15/16 and 19/16 time signature during the process. The song was intended to be an intense one according to the lore. The intro started with the melody from 7/4 Part (Uncertainty) in Essence. Then we used the simple subdivisions for the 15/16 and 19/16, namely 7+8 and 5+5+5+4 respectively. For the strings,  they played the chords with the bass notes, while some chords actually had some tensions to make it correspond with the melody and intensity.</p>
<p>Another fun fact is that the 2nd half after the intermission (13/16), the rhythm subdivisions for percussion is the same as LNCryption</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/indekkusu/lncryption">[osu!mania LN Tournament 3] LNCryption by HowToPlayLN</a></p>
<p>Actually, the rhythm was also inspired by my another track in <strong>self. EP</strong>, Self-Contradictory.</p>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/indekkusu/self-contradictory">Self-Contradictory by HowToPlayLN</a></p>
<p>Both LNCryption and Self-Contradictory actually have the related lore, including the fact of the overwhelming thoughts, and the consequences of them at the end. However, Polychromatic Dissociation is more of the representation of the chaos in Zion after the C.O.V.I.D outbreak.</p>
<p>It was intended to be a little easter egg that, this lore is related to LNCryption and as mentioned that there were some LNCryption references throughout the lore text.</p>
<h3>Stardust Antagonism (Imaginary Reality)</h3>
<p>How this song was made was a bit of a funny story. So initially this song was made from a testing session where I tried to write in 5/4 while testing a piano suggested by Raytoly, then after knowing that there’s a free slot for the lore song, I decided to extend it to 2 mins. Initially, the song is just at 1 min mark, and I started to add the cellos after that to extend to 2 mins.</p>
<p>For this song, I’ve challenged myself to write fully in 5/4 as I have never written a song in irregular time signature before. Although there are exceptions that a few bars are in 6/4 or 3/4, but most of the parts are in 5/4. For reference, please refer to this video for the time signature info:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxKq-sRQM8o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxKq-sRQM8o</a></p>
<p>After the song is finished, I sent it to HowToPlayLN, and he suggested to try tuning the song in microtonal, so I did, and it instantly made the song 1000% more emotional. To tune it microtonal, what I did is stretching the audio file. By stretching an audio file, it’s frequency and wavelength changes as well, so if I stretch the audio file, the wavelength becomes larger, the frequency becomes lower, and hence, the pitch becomes lower. Originally the key is in C#, after stretching it, it becomes C half-sharp key. Originally, the bpm is in 122 as well, but after stretching it, it becomes 119bpm.</p>
<p><strong>HowToPlayLN:</strong> Yes, my first impression of the song really gives an empty and desperation vibe, which could be enhanced by tuning down the entire song by half-sharp, giving a vibe that was like, “Something is off” which also corresponded with the lore that there was the anomalies happened in Zion.</p>
<h3>Cognitohazadrous Ocular Vision Impairing Disease (HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p>So I contacted Akiri to join the album also, and I was in charge of making a midi. This was actually planned to be more of the electronic and modern feeling, as the lore mentioned about how we tried to connect the dots between the death of polychroma, the LNCryption and the catastrophe in Zion.</p>
<p>The melody in the melodic hardcore part was written using 5-5-6 subdivisions, as well as the hidden 1547 in it, for example:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1086685809677176882/image.png" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1086685809677176882/image.png"></p>
<p>yes.</p>
<h3>Throughout the Memories (Imaginary Reality &amp; HowToPlayLN)</h3>
<p><strong>Cello + some other instruments (Imaginary Reality)</strong></p>
<p>This song was actually made last year September, just me trying to write a cello duet while citing my past custom songs. Then HowToPlayLN approaches me and ask me for the midi to test something, then after hearing how he arranges the piano, I asked him if we want to include it in the lore song, and boom, the song is born.
And again, the original arrangement is around 1:30, it was only then we decided to extend a bit and cite more stuff into it.</p>
<p>Here are the songs that I’ve cited in my part:</p>
<ol>
<li>[0:22] Rules of the Chaos Dilemma from EGTS2022 SF TB (which actually is cited from Asgore theme from Undertale)</li>
<li>[0:54] Bach: Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major (except I rearrange it into C# minor/A major)</li>
<li>[1:15] Fullest Adventure from the Abyss to Divine from OMT2022 GF TB</li>
<li>[1:47] Essence lick (1547)</li>
<li>[2:08] Finale Battle of the Requiem from OMT2021 GF TB</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Panning (Imaginary Reality)</strong></p>
<p>Again, the instruments are panned here to get a better mix, in this song, both of the cellos are placed between the piano, meaning one cello is at the right, one at the left, and the piano and other instruments are in the center.</p>
<p><strong>Piano (HowToPlayLN)</strong></p>
<p>When I got some ideas from the takehirotei’s Cello Duet, I decided to try writing the melody-countermelody piano duet (or actually some people may count it as Fugue). The idea is both to support the cello at where they’re deserved to be the main melody, and fill up the parts where the cellos act like the accomponiment, as well as adding the response to the cello melody in the Chaos Dilemma and Abyss Divine Part.</p>
<p>Here are the songs that I’ve cited in my part:</p>
<ol>
<li>[0:16] rN - onostrapha, Camellia - Nasty Nasty Spell, The Lick</li>
<li>[0:22] takehirotei - Rules of the Chaos Dilemma</li>
<li>[1:15] Bossa Nova Pattern and Indomitable Spirit</li>
<li>[1:25] takehirotei - Fullest Adventure from the Abyss to Divine</li>
<li>[1:33] Essence (Uncertainty) + The Lick</li>
<li>[1:35] Arctic Indexed Systems. - Nightburner</li>
</ol>
<p>For this particular piece, it was composed before we started to think about the lore, it reminded me of the memories from starting the tournament until the current state, as I also mentioned about these songs in the cryptic way that it corresponded with the lore.</p>
<h3>Essence ~among the constellations~</h3>
<p><strong>Piano + main flow (HowToPlayLN)</strong></p>
<p>I literally speedrunned arranging this in one day LOL</p>
<p>Long Story short, it was me trying to improvise over the Essence theme in the real piano, then I transcribed it in Musescore (which as well was the improvised version of the improvisation). It was made in a matter of a simple swing groove, yet explains all the journey we went through.</p>
<p><strong>Instrument arrangements (takehirotei)</strong></p>
<p>After HowToPlayLN have provided the piano parts, I started adding instruments to it. As it sounds jazzy, we decided to go with a live performance style, except it wasn't a live performance. So I choose the following instruments: jazz drum kit (from FL Studio stock kits), Synth, Electric bass guitar, electric guitar, Celesta, solo cello, and string sections.</p>
<p>And again, the instruments are panned to simulate the real world so that it sounds like an actual live performance.</p>
<h3>Essence ~drifting among the constellations~ (Imaginary Reality)</h3>
<p>It all started with this tweet</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AdamAckerville/status/1611011451623440388?s=20&amp;t=mzq9LmHnH_pn-pxPRHk9Dg">https://twitter.com/AdamAckerville/status/1611011451623440388?s=20&amp;t=mzq9LmHnH_pn-pxPRHk9Dg</a></p>
<p>So we joke around a bit and wonder what if we use this meme, but replaced the audio with essence during the grand finals week, and sent it to the players. (credits to HowToPlayLN for the audio)</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1017516359040630795/1060902668983349388/lmao_final_edit.mp4">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1017516359040630795/1060902668983349388/lmao_final_edit.mp4</a></p>
<p>And then we saw this reply</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PorkIsGreat/status/1611100406578577408?s=20&amp;t=ySOGjf5Ghctjit9zDY-N5Q">https://twitter.com/PorkIsGreat/status/1611100406578577408?s=20&amp;t=ySOGjf5Ghctjit9zDY-N5Q</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1086687310927630397/Screenshot_403.png" alt="Screenshot_403.png"></p>
<p>And we wondered, what if Essence is in Eurobeat. Then I decided to do the funny and quickly speedrun a eurobeat remix of essence + yoru ni kakeru. Since it’s something that’s not serious, I decided to just reuse a eurobeat template that I have already made.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5-Ao2ChVT8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5-Ao2ChVT8</a></p>
<p>Since this is just a joke remix, so we decided to make it as a bonus track in the album.</p>
<h3>Bonus: Crescent Moon Island but it’s Bossa Nova</h3>
<p>The first draft was made half a year ago for the funny purposes, then Poly asked for the jazz/elevator music for the classy resturant, which I actually decided to extend the second part and rendered it in <strong><strong>Musescore 4</strong></strong> which gives the more “classy” feel due to the echo of the Vibraphone. The melody other than crescent moon island was all improvised, but still maintain the feelings of bossa nova and the motif of crescent moon island.</p>
<h2>Mastering</h2>
<p><strong>takehirotei:</strong> Since it’s an album, so of course there will be someone who master the songs. Although the songs are already mastered before, but when its published into an album, the person who in charges of mastering needs to make sure the loudness range of each songs isn't too far from each other, so that the listeners wont have to manually adjust the volume knob everytime when a song changes while listening to the album.</p>
<p>For this case, most of the songs are mastered to around -5 to -9 LUFS. However, there are some songs that I did not master it on that range due to its intensity is not suitable, those songs are Essence, and Cognitohazadrous Ocular Vision Impairing Disease (this one is not mastered by me due to Akiri’s request). As the nature of these songs is more intense, so I mastered them to around -3 LUFS.</p>
<h2>Graphics</h2>
<p><strong>Poly:</strong> At a time around December where o!mLN3 released its last pool, HowToPlayLN and takehirotei already started work on Essence. It was at this point where I was specially tasked to create a jacket for the song itself, with the visualization of 1547 as a constellation in the night sky. With those ideas, I made the sketch, and DannyPX came in with some visual enhancements which are the heavy inspirations for the final custom beatmap background!</p>
<p>This is the first sketch of background for Essence (HowToPlayLN)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1077223421362057376/IMG_20221202_153538_1.jpg" alt="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1077223421362057376/IMG_20221202_153538_1.jpg"></p>
<p>The album art you see now, is actually originally the cover for the single! Funny thing is, the single release went from creation of simply that single, to an EP (which is slightly shorter than an album), to a full-fledged album that details the lore of 4DM2023 and even features special mixes!</p>
<p>I believe the videos themselves deserve a section on their own, so I’ve split them into the following section.</p>
<h2>Showcase Videos aka “BGA”</h2>
<p><strong>Poly:</strong> Funny enough, 99% of the assets I use are stock footages. I personally don’t have much money or time to spend on making 3D assets and original footages, so I made myself a challenge, which is to maximise the use of stock footages.</p>
<p>Following the writing of every chapter of the story, the corresponding song for the week would have already been composed (thanks to the passion and apititude of HowToPlayLN, takehirotei and Akiri), and I would move on to brainstorm and figure out the footages I needed to create a scene corresponding to the part of the story I wanted to tell with it.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, the songs were short and not much was to be prefaced other than a couple of important origin plot points, including the death of Polychroma (in Qualifiers showcase) and the travel to Zion (in RO32 showcase). In those videos, I simply stitched together some scenes with text, such as the tunnel walk and an animation of a spaceship window.</p>
<p>Subsequent videos saw the introduction of some BMS BGA influences, such as music visualizers, or scenes that switched to the music. This was more apparent from Quarterfinals showcase onwards, where every song spanned about 2 minutes, and had a structure rich enough to tell the whole story.</p>
<p>Many of the times, I would find myself looking towards finding certain footages I would not be able to make myself within the time frame (examples include the 3D zoom used in Semifinals). Davinci Resolve (the software I used for all the BGAs made - credits to Arccat for the recommendation!) does include a rather robust array of tools to edit, so lots of the color grading, audio panning, and even the parallax zoom of stars in Finals, were all produced in the studio. Additionally, I was still a pretty big noob at the software at the start, so I looked up a lot of tutorials to learn the ropes, and I’m really grateful for all the learning I’ve done on this.</p>
<p>Though, the Grandfinals showcase videos were not done by me, but rather TheFunk, who was also the main star behind all the flashy showcase videos done in o!mLN3, and this tournament would be of no exception. Huge shoutout to him for the really cool GFX for P0rn0 and for the Essence showcase! Without all of this work I would have been up every night till 6am. The media centre people know this best! ahuhe</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>HowToPlayLN:</strong> It was really a huge opportunity to be involved in this project. To be honest I haven’t got to thank you everyone for this ride yet due to my mental and physical fatigue. But overall it was a really fun and unique experience working with the lore progression, the songs as well as the album, as well as I had seen the audiences’ reactions on the lore, the tiebreaker showcase and the ending credits. I would like to thank everyone with all of my heart. This tournament was not actually just an osu!mania event to me, but it is the moment of my life, the fruit of hard work and the culmination of a valiant effort to create the essence. Thank you everyone again.</p>
<p><strong>takehirotei/Imaginary Reality:</strong> Originally, I was only in charge on the GFTB song with HowToPlayLN, but after seeing HowToPlayLN and the others work on the lore and stuff, I’ve decided to join the fun as well. Although the lore songs that I made were something that have been done halfway long time ago, it was great to see them being used in something this big instead of just releasing them normally.</p>
<p>I would like to thank HowToPlayLN and the 4DM team again for the opportunity to take part in this amazing project, although I’m only involved in a few songs, it’s definitely an amazing experience for me, and I will cherish this forever. And lastly, I would also like to thank everyone for listening and reading our works throughout the tourney &lt;3</p>
<p><strong>Poly:</strong> All in all, it’s been a huge ride making these videos. There were times I considered giving up with how much workload I’ve had to handle over the weeks, but the story had to be completed for all of you.</p>
<p>To those who have been following the lore and videos with dedication, thank you once again for your support. Even if some things don’t make sense, such as the LNCryption documentations, this is a work I’ve conjured basically with all my heart. It attempts to encompass what makes our lives special, which is the ability to recognize life and emotions. While wandering in the stars and the jokes we made about pasta, I hope that this point drives home, and that this tournament was not simply just another 3v3 tournament that emulates MWC, but also a heartwarming experience where the hearts break and souls heal.</p>
<p>With all of the sub-articles released, I figured that this would basically be the last of the series to be released. With that, thank you so much for patronizing the 4DMWC Media Centre. May our paths cross again!</p>
