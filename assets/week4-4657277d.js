<h2>Navigating the Uncertainty</h2>
<p>The girl I had picked up from the streets, left chaos behind for Zion in the news of her mysterious death.</p>
<p>It seems that being isolated on the spaceship for 2 millenia had given me an alibi strong enough to be involved in the girl's death. However, it can't be said the same for everyone else. There was visible confusion and conflict among the residents as they could not tell paint from blood, or orange from ball, accrued to the colors leaving their eyes. <em>Miscommunication</em> and <em>mistranslation</em> of sentiment was rampant as many got lynched by the color tests, and lots of suspicion arose between the closest of friends.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the climate was acting up. Spring was supposed to be around the corner. However, the media centre reported temperatures reaching negatives around the equator. Due to the extreme humidity there, huge snow typhoons have formed, but surprisingly, they travelled upwards into the skies. It was still an <em>uncertainty</em> to whether it was the snow, or the events of <em>Stardust Antagonism</em>, or just an incident that happened in the cycle of rotation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the complete opposite was happening on the other end of the planet. There was a rain of unidentified objects that looked man-made. The pattern can be recognized within every seven time intervals. The objects that are falling down can be as deadly as they look, causing countless deaths and immeasurable damage to the city. People prophesized that this was the doing of angry martians who wanted to take over the planet for their own civilization.</p>
<p>Is it the <em>uncertainty</em>? Or just the <em>consequences</em> of our own inhuman actions? <em>What could we do but to reap the seeds we sow?</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Back at the ETI Research Lab, biologists studied the girl's lifeless body. The ETI detected an anomaly within her body. It was an unfamiliar substance with an unknown chemical structure, a unique one of an unidentified origin. However, the <strong>Sophisticated Discrete Event System Simulation to Explicitly Find the Expectation using Next-Event Time Advance Mechanism</strong>, or to be precise, <strong>Truncation of Indicated Determinant &amp; Unified Relations (TIDUR)</strong> model, traced back into the far past, where a similar incident happened with this substance. The event, as simulated, predicted the <em>overcomplexification</em> of <em>starlight</em> among the constellations in the sky. They would entangle in the embrace of a solar storm, and somehow create a giant star with the greatest luminosity known to man. This star would burst into the brightest supernovae and illuminate the universe. As computed, the probability of this happening again is memoryless with a high expectation of the distribution time, it depends on who is the one who has the power to commit this incident.</p>
<p>At first, this made no sense to anyone. How could a girl already pronounced dead produce enough energy to summon a supernova?</p>
<p>Upon laying my gaze on the chemical structure, I seemed to get a deja-vu feeling from it. Suddenly, I felt a chill down my spine, with the pain of glass shards piercing into my mind, like a curse of the past. It didn't seem to last for very long, but I was sure that this would keep coming back time and time again.</p>
<p>Studying her autopsy revealed a gruesome image of her internal organs decomposing into masses of red and black. Yet, nothing seemed to have indicated that her body imploded within itself, or that she was poisoned with acid by anyone. There were no thumbprints or abnormal substances within her body aside from the structure. There didn't seem to be a natural or a known murder method that could pinpoint the cause of her death.</p>
<p><em>This isn't a normal case of murder or disease. Could whatever I was feeling be related to the cause of her disintegration?</em></p>
<p>That thought also forced me to approach seemingly mythological literature texts, which were direct anti-theses to the rigorous logic of science. Spending about 2 weeks to sift through book after book of ridiculous stories and folktales, I stumbled upon a legend that discussed the <em>consequences</em> of committing immoral crimes according to universal law.</p>
<p>The legend was written in the form of a transcribed epic, introducing a narrator who seemingly found themselves in a world <em>inverted</em> in color. The narrator walked through towns, villages, castles, experiencing an adventure like an RPG. They flew in the skies, defeated enemies, explored castles, like a fantasy tale. All up to the point where some pages were tainted with dark splatters. Looking through those pages, they seemed to cover chapter after chapter of mental torture, leading to reflections of the sins they had committed.</p>
<p>It was often said that hell is other people, but putting yourself with a self-image of yourself seemed to be another new hell, according to the narrator. The <em>consequences</em> justified the pain they experienced.</p>
<p>From the chapter named <strong>Emulation</strong>, the narrator seemed to lose control of their own senses and emotions in a false reality, creating a splitting image of themselves.</p>
<p>This gradually led to the <strong>Unsynchronization</strong> chapter, where against the desire of whom the narrator wanted to be, the splitting image gradually started paralyzing the real image in ways that the real image would have done to others, and gave the real image hallucinations as dreadful as their own nightmares.</p>
<p>These phases didn't appear in the book very frequently at first. But as I got to the last 100 pages, I noticed that every single page was soaked in the same shade of grey. There was a very real rotting scent invading the smell of paper as I struggled to finish the book. The narrator seemed to highlight this chapter <strong>Escape</strong>, where their real image could never see the inverted world ever again. Their sense of self and emotion were forever <em>encrypted</em> in an eternally dark void, consisting of only themselves, and the splitting image.</p>
<p>On the last page, the narrator left a mysterious conversation between the real image, and the splitting image, or whatever it was. The narrator was able to make a <em>last wish</em> in reflection of the <em>consequences</em> they experienced from this <em>inversion</em>. The last words of the book, I read it out loud: <em>&quot;I understand that I would lose the ability to feel, ability to see the colors, or even the ability to live life meaningfully in this cruel universe. I understand that life without meaning is as scary as eternal death. But I wish to live.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Closing the book in understanding of the effects of living after the events of <em>inversion</em>, I felt like the narrator, this lifeless body and I went through the same fate. The consequences from trying to break through the moral limits that a human body could handle. If indeed, as the narrator said, <strong>color</strong>, <strong>emotion</strong> and <strong>life</strong> formed the impossible trinity tipping the balance of this wish, I doubt that <em>she</em> lost the ability to feel at the moment of her death. Perhaps she still has her emotions and colors attached on her spirit.</p>
<p>At this point I was left to connect the dots. If she really had that immense of a power to ignite a supernova, what was this power used for? Is it possible for us to resurrect her? Is the possibility of resurrection related to the <em>encryption</em>? If she indeed fell into the <em>inversion</em> of her past life, what kind of <em>consequences</em> did she experience? In response, what was the <em>last wish</em> that was granted to her? More importantly, why was her body left out there hanging in the outskirts of Zion?</p>
<p>Surely someone was up to no good, and there had to be a way of finding out who did it and why. Thus, we began the <em>progress</em> of finding the truth...</p>
<p>Upon further investigation, through the countless papers and databases, we were able to find her name, and her evidence of existence in this universe. Perhaps she is the key that will connect all the dots between the virus outbreak, the faked murder scene, and this ridiculous legend.</p>
<p>Her name was <em>polychroma</em>.</p>
