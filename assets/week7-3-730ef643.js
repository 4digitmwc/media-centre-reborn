<p><strong>Hi DemiFiendSMT! How are you doing?</strong></p>
<p>DemiFiendSMT: I'm doing well, thanks. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>I'm doing great! Having to opportunity to interview the one and only DemiFiendSMT! You played a big part in the mappooling of 4DMWC 2023! How did the pooling process work for you?</strong></p>
<p>DemiFiendSMT: It was a very interesting experience, although tiring mentally. It involves a lot of testing to gauge numerous parameters such as balancing, playability, difficulty... Besides, it's not a lone work: poolers always rely on playtesters, who basically simulate how the players in the tournament would see the pools.</p>
<p>That being said, me and chxu were always looking for new charts, sometimes really close to the showcase, because testers found issues we couldn't find in the drafting process. Huge props to all the testers for all the help throughout the tournament, we couldn't have done it without them.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a great social experience for me; made new friends, learned new useful stuff (not only about osu), and it was a great delight seeing players' reactions to the pools.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever pool for other tournaments prior to 4DMWC 2023? Regardless if you did or not, what was the biggest challenge you had to face in 4DMWC in terms of the quality control in the mappooling department?</strong></p>
<p>DemiFiendSMT: No, 4DM23 was my first actual pooling experience, although I did playtest for quite a few tournaments before, so I was a bit familiarised with how the process went. I received a good amount of info from Logan and Chxu at the beginning, which helped a lot and made things go smoother.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge was definitely the scaling. At the beginning, Paturages, me and chxu decided on a certain level we would aim when making the pools, but as soon as the teams were decided and we saw the players, we knew the level would be extremely low and would result in accuracy battles from start to end. Our doubts were confirmed when the qualifier scores came out; that made our pooling very stormy for a good while - we had to rely a lot on the playtesters to understand what level we should aim at. At the end, there are a few things I acknowledge we should have done differently, but I'm happy that the final rounds' results and scores were as expected from the players.</p>
<p><strong>As far as everyone has known, you yourself are a 4 digit player, and unfortunately because of your accomplishments for Brazil in 4KMWC 2022, you are ineligible for 4DMWC 2023. For this year, did you prefer to play for the Brazilian team in 4DMWC? Or are you fine being a mappooler because of your performances in 4KMWC?</strong></p>
<p>DemiFiendSMT: I didn't even consider joining; I'm well aware I'm past my 4 digits era when I tried joining last year and got banned. It would be nonsense to try to signup one year later considering I continued improving.</p>
<p>I offered to help as playtester, and after a while Logan offered the pooler role. I thought it would be an interesting experience and went onboard with it</p>
<p><strong>Has pooling helped you improve on your abilities to play mania?</strong></p>
<p>DemiFiendSMT: That's for sure; pooling was a major help in keeping my interest towards the game, and was a fun experience getting better while testing the later game pools, especially in the rice side.</p>
<p><strong>What does the future hold for DemiFiendSMT after this tournament? Will we see you become a pooler for more tourneys? Or will we see you compete on more mania tournaments in the foreseeable future?</strong></p>
<p>DemiFiendSMT: After MWC 2022, my time became extremely limited to play the game, however I still do so as a hobby, usually 2-3 times a week. That has proven to be more than enough for me to keep a steady improve as long as I do it correctly. With that said, I still joined tournaments like OMLN3 and SOL3, which were a really nice experience. I probably will join a few more tournaments here and there, and maybe help pooling in others, while trying to maintain a steady improvement and having fun with the game. Those 2 years since I started were quite lengthy both in-game and IRL and felt like it was more than 5 years, but it was a fun experience up to now :)</p>
<h2>Eclipse_</h2>
<p><strong>So first off, how are you doing?</strong></p>
<p>Eclipse_: I'm quite fine, but my interest in the game is waning a lot lately</p>
<p><strong>You are a playtester that really helped out a lot providing feedback for the poolers. How did you help the mappoolers determine what maps should be put into the pool with the feedback for the maps you playtested for 4DM this year?</strong></p>
<p>Eclipse_: So for how much I helped, I think I helped decently much - I didn't playtest everything, especially early on (and in grand finals because of my skill level) but I was met with a lot of appreciation so I think my feedback was helpful.</p>
<p>What I did precisely was playtest maps and evaluate first how fair they are and if they are of good quality, second whether or not they fit in their category of the mappool, and third whether their difficulty was on par with other picks in the same pool, and if it was a natural progression from the same pick in the previous round.</p>
<p>So fairness/quality, categorization, and difficulty balance.</p>
<p>Receiving such feedback from multiple playtesters can really shape the mappoolers' view of certain picks before the pools are finalized, and it grants a deeper insight into what kinds of people do well or struggle on different types of patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Like very few, you have a history of your own behind 4DMWC. You competed as a player in 4DMWC 2020 &amp; 2022, and while you didn't compete on 2021, 2 maps of your own were in 4DMWC 2021. So I want to ask how has the pooling evolved over the last 4 years as a player &amp; a mapper?</strong></p>
<p>Eclipse_: In terms of purely the trends for what the pools feature, I think it has gotten a bit more technical and a bit bolder in a controlled way.</p>
<p>In terms of quality I think it has much improved over the years, the poolers now more than ever are aware of the conventions of the mania tournament scene and know how to execute them well, as well as when it is beneficial for the tournament experience to break them. Especially being in staff this year I can see just how much thought and careful preparation went into the mappools, and it makes me proud to have been a part of this event, knowing very well that not all tourneys could say the same.</p>
<p><strong>As you mentioned at the start, your interest in the game has been waning. So my final question is that what is the future of Eclipse_ heading into the future? Will we see you around for more tourneys or will you just be apart of the community for fun?</strong></p>
<p>Eclipse_: I have no idea what's ahead of me in terms of the community really - my interest in the game has been waxing and waning over the years, but this is the first time I'm losing interest in osumania while still being interested in rhythm games more broadly speaking (notably in Sound Voltex, Chunithm, Arcaea), so I've taken it as a sign that I'm slowly moving on.</p>
<p>However, I can definitely say I have made good friends in the community and there definitely are people with whom I still would want to talk and work with more, so I'm not excluding any scenario really. Time will tell!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for taking this time and I hope the best of luck on your future endeavors!</strong></p>
<p>Eclipse_: Thanks for your time :)</p>
<h2>FelixSpade</h2>
<p><strong>Hi FelixSpade! How are you doing today?</strong></p>
<p>FelixSpade: I'm good. Actually, I'm in my recovery state after getting flu 3 days before. I'm feeling better than yesterday</p>
<p><strong>Well, nice to hear you are recovering from a terrible flu! So you are a mapper that was involved with the 4DM pooling. You were involved with the LN department, creating 4 maps, collabed with HTPLN on one LN map, and the special grand finals tiebreaker. I want to ask how do you create maps that would fit into the expectations of the playtesters &amp; mappoolers?</strong></p>
<p>FelixSpade: I usually know first what difficulty they want to put in the pools. I referenced it from the older pool of the tourney for the estimation. The key point of this reference usually comes from the BPM. I use the lower BPM like under 200 for the maps that use for Ro64 to Quarterfinals.</p>
<p>After that, song-choice wise, I often recycle the older ranked maps into LNs. What I mean as recycle here is to make the players feel the nostalgia on the song they played in early mania days. Take example, Lord=Crossight and PUPA. Those songs are make the players relive their experience on how they play at first time. That is the goal to enjoy some players.</p>
<p>Patterning-wise, I'm inspired by Shoegazer's charting technique combined with LNs like eZmmR's style or lemonguy's style with a little bit of a twist. I layer the rice first, then the LNs. Now, the twist is that I often layered the LNs on how the intensity of the song is. If the song is building up, then I layer the LNs from sparse to dense. If it is very intense, usually it becomes the LN Density.</p>
<p>Well, this style is from my early loved LN map like Despair of ELFERIA. It becomes some players liking, and poolers have liking that too. Even when I'm cooking something, a playtester PM me to play the chart that I cooked lol</p>
<p><strong>When you create maps, I would think there seems to be some restrictions compared from making maps for yourself vs making maps exclusively for tournaments. What was the biggest challenge you would have making maps for tournaments?</strong></p>
<p>I make chart for myself when I'm in mood for experimenting something. Something that maybe can't be usable for tournaments. Like weird releases and weird technical for LNs. These are the ones that I'm afraid to use it to tourney. It maybe not fun or too boring for the people to play. As for making maps for tourneys, I know how the limits and its fun to create them.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is on how I make a harder maps that are playable to players. I often stumble on this because of the imbalanced diff spike. It maybe easy or it maybe hard so that the players can't handle it.</p>
<p><strong>You did have a map being used back in 4DMWC 2022, which was the first time player's were able to see your work as a mapper. Now a year later, like I mentioned, you were involved with a lot of maps. How has your growth been in a span of a year since 4DMWC 2022?</strong></p>
<p>FelixSpade: I got involved in omLN3 Special thanks to Poly for inviting me as a custom mapper!, and I got pumped up to chart to the point of experimenting like LN dumps. That is because of the 9-months planning to build a pool. At that first time, I had the feeling of contributing to a tourney. Even I want that something is hard for the players to struggle.</p>
<p>All that 9-months, I produced 4 charts and 6 collab charts and that make players amazed with the help of HowToPlayLN, Raveille, and Logan. Especially HowToPlayLN that gives me some ideas and a push to do something great.</p>
<p>After that, I got offer from SoL3 staff and 4DMWC 2023 staff to be a custom mapper. Also, I got Quietus Ray ranked that this map were used back in 4DMWC4!</p>
<p>It's not so much to say in this 1 year, but it definitely is a big growth for me.</p>
<p><strong>What is the future of FelixSpade heading into the aftermath of 4DMWC 2023? Will we see you become a mapper for more high profiled mania tournaments? What are your goals as a mapper in osumania?</strong></p>
<p>FelixSpade: If the hosts are willing to scout me, then by all means go ahead!</p>
<p>For my goals are just this:</p>
<p>As long as players found it fun, its already a goal to me. Everything is just a plus like being scouted for custom mappers and other mapping projects. For the ultimate goal, if players can find about how my feelings pour into the charts because I love on how to interpret my feelings about the song into patterns. Either being aggressive, or being soft.</p>
