<p>Hello! As you have probably read the title, this is a generic guide for improving in osu!mania, and VSRGs in general. This guide will briefly sweep over gameplay. But the main portion of this guide will focus more on individual mentality towards the game. If you’re not interested in me babbling about gameplay or nerding out over skins, feel free to skip to the juicy stuff.</p>
<h2>Introduction to mania</h2>
<p>osu!mania is a game mode in the game osu!. It is classified as a Vertical-Scrolling Rhythm Game (VSRG), where notes fall down or up the screen. The player will have to press the correct key for that specific note in time for the note to be considered hit. osu!mania has multiple key-modes ranging from 1 key to 18 keys for players to experience. The majority of players meddle in the 4 key and 7 key modes, as some of the most popular VSRGs before osu!mania used these key-modes. osu!mania stems from games such as Stepmania and Beatmania IIDX, and most of the playerbase hail back to these games.</p>
<h2>Core Gameplay</h2>
<p>The heart and soul of mania is its simplicity. Players have to hit notes that move up or down the screen at a certain point of the screen with a corresponding key. The speed at which the notes move across the screen, as well as the keys used can be fully customised to a player’s preference. Players may also choose to use skins, which can change gameplay to suit a player’s playstyle as well.</p>
<h2>Patterns</h2>
<p>In osu!mania, patterns describe the sequence in which notes are placed in the map. There are numerous patterns in the game, but this guide will only cover some of the more common ones.</p>
<p>Before we get into patterns, we have to understand some basic terminology used to describe notes. Single notes are self-explanatory, it is just a single note that has to be hit. Jumps are 2 notes that have to be hit at the same time with two fingers. These are described as jumps as in DDR, the player has to jump to be able to hit the two notes at the same time. Hands are three notes that have to be hit at the same time. This again is derived from DDR, where a player has to use their hand to hit the third note along with the jump. And finally, quads are 4 notes that have to be hit at the same time. And, you guessed it, the term is derived from DDR as well.</p>
<p>Moving on, we have a very common pattern seen in osu!mania maps, streams. This term is used to describe a series of single consecutive notes that have to be hit in quick succession. This is one of the main patterns in the game, with many other patterns branching out from it. An example would be jumpstreams, which are streams with 2 note chords mixed in.</p>
<p>Jacks are used to describe two or more repeating notes on the same column. The name comes from the jackhammer-like motion your fingers make while playing these patterns. Again, jacks can be categorised into many subsets, but the most common patterns you will see are Chordjacks; jacks that involve three or more columns, and speed-jacks; jacks that change columns in rapid succession.</p>
<p>Long notes, or LNs for short, are notes that a player has to hold for the duration it is on screen, as well as release it on time. Releasing a long note on time, called release timing, is what makes osu!mania unique. This is also where players may struggle a bit, but with practice they can be mastered.</p>
<p>And finally, we come to SV (Slider Velocity). Although not a pattern, they are significant in osu!mania. Slider velocity allows mappers to control the speed at which notes move across the screen, thus mappers are able to use SV to make their map more challenging, or even as a, aesthetic effect in the map.</p>
<h2>Practicing</h2>
<p>So with all the core gameplay out of the way, we finally get into actually improving at osu!mania. Although most of the community will tell a new player to “play more”, it is actually Layman’s terms for “you need to find your own technique”. A every player has their own unique preferences, which can only be discovered as they gain more experience playing the game. With that being said, this section can be broken in six parts; three parts related to gameplay and three parts related to mentality.</p>
<h3>Finding Maps</h3>
<p>The type of maps you practice play a big role in the rate of improvement you will experience. At first, players may start with very basic maps to get a feel for the game, but as players improve, they will need maps that are more challenging to improve further. As an example, a player has been comfortably passing 3 star maps with an average of 98% accuracy, but fails on 5 star maps. How would they improve to pass said 5 star map? They would start by playing more 4 star maps until they are comfortable with that difficulty, at which point the 5 star map will appear much easier to the player, as they have built the necessary muscle memory and reading ability. But lets say you want to get better at a certain type of pattern. Like a rice oriented player wanting to learn how to play Long Notes. Good news for you, the same theory can be applied, just with LN maps. However, you will need proper maps that really test the patterns if you want to improve.</p>
<p>So, where do you find these maps? Well, most of the ranked section has some decent maps for practicing patterns, but if you want the real stuff, you’ll have to do some digging. Most of the time, just typing the pattern you want into the search bar on the website works as mappers tend to tag their map with the most dominant pattern. You may also find mappers that specialise in certain patterns and play their maps. If you really want to, many maps used in tournaments are of high quality and can make good practice maps.</p>
<h3>Scroll Speed and Skin</h3>
<p>As you’ve probably guessed, scroll speeds and skins differ from player to player. However, there are ways to find your own preferences and how to adjust skins to your liking.</p>
<p>For starters, let’s look at scroll speeds. When most players start out, they tend to use very slow scroll speeds as they are processing each individual note to hit, so they need more time to react. It is normal for a player to play around with their scroll speeds as they play the game more; even some experienced players toy around with their scrolls now and then, as long as they are comfortable with the scroll speed, any scroll speed will work for the game. As a player’s reading ability improves, they will just tend to look at one point of the screen, and rely on muscle memory to hit the notes. This is the point where most players lock in their scroll speeds. Scroll speeds also depend on the skin you are using, as some skins make scroll speeds faster or slower. Wider skins take up more space on the screen, thus the distance from the notes falling to the hit window is shorter, making scroll speeds seem faster and vice versa. Many new players will think that fast scroll speeds are impressive, and although they are in a way, not everyone finds them comfortable, so players should not feel pressured to use scroll speeds they are not comfortable with. (That is with the lone exception of when you're learning to read slowjams and fastjams for SV maps, of course.)</p>
<p>Moving on to skins, there are a variety of osu!mania skins pre-made by various members of the community. A simple Google search will bring up many results, but if you would like more variety to choose from, you can look at the skins forum on the <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15">osu! website</a>. There are also many other websites and forums for you to explore, such as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OsuSkins/">osu!skins Reddit</a> and the <a href="https://compendium.skinship.xyz/">osu! skins compendium.</a> You may also search for YouTube skin compilations and gameplay videos that have the skins used linked in the description.</p>
<p>So let’s say you can’t find a skin that suits you. Well, in that case you have to get involved in the skin yourself. I’d suggest reading the <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Skinning/osu%21mania">skinning wiki</a> first if you can. As you open the skin folder, located within your osu! folder, you will see all the skins you have currently downloaded with all their contents. As you click into a skin folder, you will see a myriad of confusing text and images. Do not worry, as all the images are interchangeable with other skin elements, you just have to rename the element you want in your skin to the name of the element already inside said skin. It is confusing at first, and I’d recommend making a backup of the skin first. But the more you play with skins the better you will get, and maybe one day you will make a skin from scratch yourself!</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>The osu!mania community has many skilled players kicking about, each looking for new ways to improve their skills. So a group of players may start competing with each other, giving each other motivation and tips along the way. Some friendly competition can go a long way as well. Multiplayer matches and tournaments are good ways to have fun with members of the community, as well as making more friends along the way.</p>
<p>However, as always, there will be individuals who bring a negative influence to the community by being toxic, misbehaving, being overly obsessed with certain skillsets; you get the point. Sure, everyone has their flaws, but understanding your flaws and learning to improve them is quite possible and should be done more often. Being able to hide behind an avatar and username does not mean you are above the unspoken rules of being in a community.</p>
<h2>Mindset</h2>
<p>Having the proper mindset for anything enables you to tackle any task with efficiency. If you don’t have the right mindset, you will interpret the task as more of a chore, which leads to harder burnouts and less patience while performing the task.</p>
<p>So what is the proper mindset while playing? From what can be seen from the community, most players who play to improve are the ones who burn out the fastest. Playing for improvement puts pressure on yourself. A popular case is when players want to achieve a certain skill level by a set date. For some players, having pressure does help them improve, but most of the time when the player does not meet the skill criteria in time, they will feel demotivated and stressed as after all their hard work they did not improve as much as thy wanted. This brings about burnout and boredom, two things that can destroy your gaming experience.</p>
<p>Burnout can be a result of various causes, and can happen to anyone. When a player is having burnout, they may not enjoy the game as much as they used to, and may feel like quitting the game altogether. As said before, burnout is a natural occurrence, and can even happen in real life. So what do you do when you feel burnt out in real life? You take a holiday, go do something else that is fun, refresh your mind. Same thing in osu!mania, taking breaks and refreshing your mind from all the stress the game brings can benefit you in the long run. Sure, you will lose your feel for the game, and when you come back you will need some time to find your groove again, but do not let that be a deterrent for taking breaks; sometimes a quick refresh is all you need to unlock more potential that you didn’t realise you had.</p>
<p>After all that has been said, what is the best mindset to have while playing? Well, osu!mania is a music rhythm game. In recent times, this fact has been overlooked quite a bit, as many new players strive to be the best among their friend group, set the highest scores on maps or going far in tournaments instead of enjoying the rhythm and music aspects of the game. Players who enjoy the core concept of osu!mania are the ones who remain active the longest, as they have a genuine interest in gameplay and music. These players are able to find satisfaction in playing the game and listening to music. Not improving quickly and not setting high scores on leaderboards does not impact their motivation in the game, not feeling obsessed with being the best and having the ability to put the game aside whenever needed.</p>
<p>Not to say those who don’t share this interest are destined to fail; they just move on sooner than those who are die-hard fans of the VSRG genre. Everyone has their own path to walk, and nobody will be around forever. In due time, real life responsibilities will take up most of our free time, leaving less time to indulge in games. While we still can, treat the game as a hobby.</p>
<p>I hope this guide has helped you understand more about osu!mania, and will point you in the direction of improvement and being a better member of the community. As a closing statement, I’d like to quote a statement from one of the most popular players in the osu! community:</p>
