<p><strong>Hello Poity! How are you doing today?</strong></p>
<p>Poity: I'm doing really well! Thanks for having me today</p>
<p><strong>So you are a referee for the 4 Digit Mania World Cup this year! How does it feel being a referee for one of the most prestigious mania tournaments in the mania scene?</strong></p>
<p>Poity: I'm honored to be able to help out the 4DM staff team. I only started out as a referee a few months ago so I can't help but feel both excited and a bit nervous at the same time since this is a really renowned tournament in the 4K mania scene.</p>
<p><strong>So you have been a referee for a while now. Reffing for Mania tournaments like Osu!mania Long Note Tournament 3, Cold Open Cup, &amp; Vietnam Mania Championship 2022. But you also have reffed for other mode tournaments too. Most notably 4 Digit Catch World Cup 2022. Has this experience from previous tournaments helped you adapt into reffing mania matches?</strong></p>
<p>Poity: Reffing in all those tournaments helped me tremendously, especially when you have to make your own decision whenever an unexpected situation happens during the match. I'm somewhat a pretty indecisive person myself so all the experience gathered from those tournaments really goes a long way.</p>
<p><strong>As a referee, you are working with streamers to give them permission to access the match. Since you refereed 4 matches, and I'd assume you watch the matches. Any particular matches you enjoyed reffing for 4DMWC?</strong></p>
<p>Poity: If we are only counting the matches that I reffed then I would give it to Canada vs Hong Kong from the winner bracket of the Quarterfinals. Despite having a final score of 6-3 in favor of Canada, it was a really nail-biting match overall when sometimes the score difference between the two teams was only 3000 and teams getting their break points very early on. There was a situation when Canada decided to pick SV2, some players in the lobby was panicked for they forgot to update the map. So Canada immediately asked for a timeout and almost all players in the lobby left to practice the map again, and luckily Canada won the map and sealed the match. I found that somewhat entertaining to watch :P</p>
<p><strong>One more question: What is the future going to hold for you in terms of staffing more tournaments? And what are your goals regarding as a staff for tournaments? Do you want to branch out and try other things like streaming, sheets, etc? Or just stick with Referee?</strong></p>
<p>Poity: I would still help out in more tournaments in a foreseeable future. And apart from being a referee, making contributions to the mappools or being in a part of the mappool team in a tournament like 4DMWC is pretty much one of my dream goal, specifically as a pooler or a custom mapper. Although the role has really high requirements and I myself still have a long way to go if I want to be a part of them, I will improve my mapping skill and learn from other prominent poolers to achieve my goal. Also being a commentator sounds like a lot of fun as well and I might try that out too :D</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for this interview and best of luck in your future endeavors!</strong></p>
<p>Poity: Thanks for having me for this interview again!</p>
<h2>Dynascape</h2>
<p><strong>So Dynascape, you are a commentator for the 4 Digit Mania World Cup this year! How does it feel to commentate for one of the most prestigious tournaments in the mania scene?</strong></p>
<p>Dynascape: I felt honored to be one of the casters for 4DM this year! It's always scary applying to larger tournaments but the scope of 4DM really is something else. To say I was excited to be part of the cast every weekend is nothing short of an understatement.</p>
<p><strong>You had the opportunity to commentate a couple of matches for 4DMWC 2023. What was it like commentating matches with other casters? Is there a specific system you tend to follow with your own style of commentary?</strong></p>
<p>Dynascape: Commentating with someone I haven't before is always really fun because it's like getting a new dance partner, or doubles partner in tennis. You have to feel out their own style and adapt to it on the fly to make things go as smoothly as possible. As for the ones I have casted with before it's important to not get into the same rhythm for the entirety of the match, keeping discussion and ideas fresh and exciting as a commentator is one of the most important things you can contribute to the viewer experience.</p>
<p>For me I would say there are specific systems I follow, but it's divided whether or not I'm the &quot;play-by-play&quot; caster or the &quot;color&quot; caster. I wouldn't say that I have my own style of commentary necessarily (or at least that I'm aware of), but it's something that I do hope to find and refine continually in my lifespan as a commentator for this game!</p>
<p><strong>Is there a notable match you enjoyed commentating for this tournament?</strong></p>
<p>Dynascape: For me I really enjoyed commentating every match for different reasons, but the one that readers can go back to and grasp most tangibly would have to be Germany vs. Mexico with Paturages. It wasn't really a hype match or anything like that with Germany taking it 6-2, however I think Paturages and I really provided a very solid block of commentary! No dead time, no awkward pauses, just two commentators bouncing discussion for an hour and supplementing the game going on. It just felt like the both of us were on point and in sync that day and heightened each others' levels.</p>
<p><strong>As a commentator, is there any particular goals you want to accomplish in the osumania tournament scene? Any big tournaments you strive to reach for the future? Or are you just commentating to have fun?</strong></p>
<p>Dynascape: I have two goals as a commentator: to be one of the select few commentating for the Mania World Cup, and to be recognized more and more in the tournament community. Hopefully I can tick off both of these boxes this year, but at the end of the day I really am just commentating because I enjoy it greatly, and enjoy the people I've met in the staffing scene.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks Dynascape for the interview! Best of luck to your future endeavors!</strong></p>
<p>Dynascape: Thank you too Pork, hope to see you in the casting booth with me soon ;)</p>
<h2>NightNarumi</h2>
<p><strong>Hello NightNarumi, how are you doing?</strong></p>
<p>NightNarumi: Heya o/ I am doing all good, thank you! Glad to be here haha! I am honestly surprised that you decided to ask me though as I am currently not that active or involved in the community</p>
<p><strong>I want to interview you because I have some compelling questions that I believe only you can only answer yourself.</strong></p>
<p>NightNarumi: Oh boy, I'll do my best xd</p>
<p><strong>But not to waste any more time: So you are a streamer for 4 Digit Mania World Cup this year! As someone who has been a streamer for 4DMWC for 4 tournaments now (2020-2023), how does it feel to be streaming for this tournament for the past 4 years now?</strong></p>
<p>NightNarumi: It has been a long time now huh? Streaming for 4DMWC has truly been fun every year, really I like how smoothly the staff team handles everything around here. Sure it has its scuffed moments from time to time and even drama can be part of it, but all in all, still a lot better than some other chaotic messes I have seen x). Also, I really like the overlays and general designs c:, Very happy to be part of it all!</p>
<p><strong>So as a Veteran of the staff team and being a former player for Belgium (2019) &amp; Netherlands (2020-2022), you've seen 4DMWC evolved during the last 4 years. In your words, how did 4DMWC evolve from the humble beginnings, into what it is now for the current mania community?</strong></p>
<p>NightNarumi: It has changed quite a lot I would say, back in 2019, when I was still playing for Belgium, I heard of 4DMWC and was like &quot;omg! This is perfect!&quot; And so I gathered a few of my fellow clicking maniacs and friends to join the tournament and have some dumb fun with them. Everyone was excited to play in this new attempt on having a MWC experience for the players that just couldn't make it for the real deal.</p>
<p>The mappools were a lot easier as well, so everyone had a decent chance of getting some plays in without feeling too much pressure on themselves (of course, these are my words, pressure was still very much a thing haha). The second edition is when I truly thought that this is it. Following the success of its debut, the tournament became the talk of the winter all around the community and naturally got followed up with a lot of registered players.</p>
<p>That year was a blast xd, had lots of fun, I think I watched nearly every match as well, I just couldn't look away haha. From there on, the quality of 4DMWC just kept going up and up. Every edition was on its peak and I thought it couldn't get better, but I was wrong every single time x). The last few editions also got their participation rules a bit altered, skill bans got introduced and successful players of the previous editions (and at one point also of MWC) weren't allowed to play anymore.</p>
<p>Despite that, the skill level of everyone didn't falter at all. Mappools got harder and players showed of their ETness again and again, they're truly getting scary x)</p>
<p>I couldn't even play this year, I got benched haha. I would say that today, 4DMWC can stand toe to toe with MWC regarding both player quality and staffing quality. Truly a job well done.</p>
<p><strong>So, as a streamer, you've worked with referees &amp; commentators. But as a streamer, you dealt with client issues that will disrupt the streams for the viewers. How did you tackle the client issues on stream live?</strong></p>
<p>NightNarumi: Having dealt with this mess of a client for such long time definitely helped a lot in solving issues quickly so we can go on with the match. It always starts with identifying what the exact problem is and more importantly, where the problem lies. Once I know that, I usually know what the solution is to that certain problem as I have encountered it many times before, the client really doesn't hold back, it's muscle memory by now x).</p>
<p>Audio issue? Reset my sound settings. Player doesn't show up? Reboot that particular client. Gameplay does not show up? The good ol' panic button saves the day.</p>
<p>Some problems have more annoying solutions though, this is when you usually see the technical difficulties screen show up on stream so I can close down the client, solve the underlying issue and set it up again to then pretend that nothing happened c:</p>
<p>The main goal here is to solve it as fast as possible with as little disruption as can be so it doesn't ruin the experience of both the viewers, players and of course the sanity of the staff</p>
<p>Albion is gonna get an heart attack if this keeps on happening xd.</p>
<p><strong>Such knowledge of the client is the reason why I enjoyed working with you during Ro32 week.</strong></p>
<p>NightNarumi: Thank you haha! glad to hear that. Funny how the further the tournament progresses and the more important matches become, the less stressed out the staff are with the lesser amount of matches to take care of.</p>
<p><strong>One more question, as someone who's been in this tournament scene for over 5 years now, what is the future going to hold for you in future tourneys as a staffer?</strong></p>
<p>NightNarumi: If time allows me to, to keep on helping out as a streamer for these awesome tourneys obviously! I'd like to think that the name change from this tournament where instead of having a number, indicating which iteration it is, to have the year behind it. So the name can look pretty for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>I see. Thanks NightNarumi for taking this time to answer my questions! Best of luck in whatever you do in the future!</strong></p>
<p>NightNarumi: Thank you, good luck to you too!</p>
