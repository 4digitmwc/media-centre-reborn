<p><strong>How are you guys doing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>riunosk</strong>: I want to eat tze char fried rice</p>
<p><strong>awdse22</strong>: Just the usual, dying inside from life and commitments and watching our team in shambles</p>
<p><strong>oyama mahiro</strong>: I am currently having an iden tei tei meltdown!</p>
<p><strong>McButt</strong>: I finally finished my assignments just to start slaving away at group project for the next 2 weeks…</p>
<p><strong>Neon-Hooray</strong>: I caught a flu and sneeze during 4dm matches.</p>
<p><strong>TheOPmeme</strong>: I am in shambles, the rest are doing fine though</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations on your victory against Canada! It was a very close battle against Canada. As you guys got revenge against the team that knocked you out of 4DMWC 2022, What was the thought process like for you guys to fight against a tough team?</strong></p>
<p><strong>riunosk</strong>: Neon horror no more miss in tb plez</p>
<p><strong>awdse22</strong>: Even as the captain of the sg 4dm team last year, I don't really think of it as a revenge in anyway, but nothing can get rid of the scheduling PTSD I got from Canada and how much of a shitshow it was for 4dm sg team last year in general. Personally I thought we will lose against canada anyway so like, just play</p>
<p><strong>oyama mahiro</strong>: Overall i was just malding at the triple jacks in the mappool</p>
<p><strong>McButt</strong>: Qe were kinda scared actually because we knew canada had like the accuracy of all time</p>
<p><strong>Neon-Hooray</strong>: Canada is a really strong team, consisting of 6 players that excel in multiple different skillsets. Since the start of 4dm, I have seen Canada's scores, all of them having really really good ratios and accuracy. Canada is a well-rounded team overall and they seem to be consistent in every single skillset, making it look like no one stood a chance against them. With such a strong performance set by them for the past few rounds, it was especially scary to be facing such a tough opponent.</p>
<p><strong>TheOPmeme</strong>: Honestly, my brain just go ooga booga on claren map (Sv1). Never expected FC on TB as well having 7 miss for my previous and first attempt on the map in score V1 Also, FL grind so pretty cool</p>
<p><strong>For the first time ever in Singapore’s history in 4DMWC. You guys will be finishing in the Top 3. How do you guys feel knowing Singapore will guarantee themselves their best finish yet?</strong></p>
<p><strong>riunosk</strong>: First time earning money online</p>
<p><strong>awdse22</strong>: Idk, for me I don't rly care about history. We get money so yay I guess.</p>
<p><strong>oyama mahiro</strong>: I feel sad that we will probably not get a cat because im kinda hungry and i want to eat the cat</p>
<p><strong>McButt</strong>: I'm happy that we get some free $$</p>
<p><strong>Neon-Hooray</strong>: I feel sick</p>
<p><strong>TheOPmeme</strong>:</p>
<p><em>And amazing as it seems (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)</em></p>
<p><em>It all started with a dream</em></p>
<p><em>But the dreaming isn't done</em></p>
<p><em>'Cause the best is yet to come</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</em></p>
<p><em>Our home, our heart, our Singapore</em> (sauce: NDP 2019)</p>
<p><strong>You will be facing against China in the Winner’s finals. What will you guys expect from China going into this match?</strong></p>
<p><strong>riunosk</strong>: hello yobrevelc and GB gang</p>
<p><strong>awdse22</strong>: 中国打得非常好 (China played very well.)</p>
<p><strong>oyama mahiro</strong>: i expect to see my combro cup teammate molli!!! Maybe i can say owo and they instantly let us win for free  (ゝω・´★)</p>
<p><strong>McButt</strong>: i will be shivering my timbers as china is the good (My teammate of another mania tournament have one China 4dm player. Maybe i can say owo to him and make us win the game (ゝω・´★)) I LOVE YOU MOLLI</p>
<p><strong>Neon-Hooray</strong>: I expect China</p>
<p><strong>TheOPmeme</strong>: Scary team, they definitely deserved seed 2 and maybe even 1st seeding, ln is one thing for them, consistency as well. Imagine TB again. Give us social credit points as well. Oh yea, also 中国，让我们来个精彩的决赛吧！(China, let’s have a wonderful finals match!)</p>
<p><strong>How has the Singapore mania community reacted to your guys match against Canada?</strong></p>
<p>(Entire Singapore Team posting meme pictures)</p>
<p><strong>awdse22</strong>: Idk I don't think a lot of them watched or followed up with 4dm matches.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Malaysia</h2>
<p><strong>How are you guys doing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Einar</strong>: Welcome to lazada service centre, what can i help you?</p>
<p><strong>Tosai-</strong>: Feeling good, just woke up from tidur.</p>
<p><strong>JayLye</strong>: Pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>Cryolien</strong>: Doing well, could be better, could be worse.</p>
<p><strong>StyGix</strong>: Just got back from work.. i want to tidur.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations on winning against Vietnam &amp; Thailand. It was a close call against Vietnam but you guys got it together, winning TB! And then you guys smoked Thailand to advance into the Finals week. What was Malaysia’s strategy coming into the Semi-Finals week?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cryolien</strong>: Thanks, it was a super difficult and stressful week especially on the Vietnam matchup. Personally, against Vietnam, we had to rely purely on anything non rice. Coupled with the fact that Einar wasn't here for that match so our lineup for certain maps had to change as well.
Against Thailand though, with Einar coming back, our morale instantly came back and we managed to get some pretty cool scores (thanks for carrying, Jay)
(edit: match against vietnam was super stressful for me especially, because i had a standard tournament match at 1400 UTC+0 and 4dm match went wayyyy into overtime that i missed half the standard match)</p>
<p><strong>StyGix</strong>: We’re more relaxed and chill against Thailand compared to Vietnam. I also did some extra practice on HB in case they need me since we don't have einar in the match against Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>Tosai_</strong>: Coming into semi finals we are definitely shocked at how hard some of the maps were, also einar is not able to join the first match against vietnam, somehow we still managed to clutch a win thanks to my teammates. It all came together in the second match against thailand when einar is available and we could definitely feels the difference in pressure for both matches.</p>
<p><strong>Einar</strong>: Hehe, isn’t the best strat is storage drive got cooked and not appear on match :STEW:</p>
<p><strong>Tosai-</strong>: Who let Einar cook?</p>
<p><strong>JayLye</strong>: When we played against Vietnam, I'm pretty worried about our rice because their rice are pretty strong. Our strategy was to pick ln and hb and get at least 1 breakpoint from their rice picks that we can be safer. I also want to thank my teammate that they tried their best during practice and match too.</p>
<p><strong>So for me, I personally knew a lot of you guys from various tournaments I’ve staffed for previously. This team is filled with a lot of tourney players with notable accomplishments. (Einar - TMC1 Champion, VLT:MT Runner-Up, JayLye &amp; StyGix - Top 6 in Osu!Mania Malaysia Tournament 2, Cryolien - TMC1 Champion &amp; 4kMWC 3rd place finisher (2021), Ju1ny - Top 8 in Osu!Mania Malaysia Tournament 1, Tosai - LN3 &amp; 4DMWC 2021) Do you guys think that the tournament experience you all have amassed over the years has really given you guys not only an edge to perform well, but also to adapt into this tournament?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tosai-</strong>: Personally i have too less experience to speak compared to the others but nerves are definitely still holding me back a lot of the time.
Also i didnt even got into omln3-seed 65 sadkek</p>
<p><strong>JayLye</strong>: For me yeah, I always tried to figure it out which thing I should improve every tournament I played. But sometimes have to depend on situations, I might did bad for some matches due nerves or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>StyGix</strong>: Tbh i can say that i can deal with nerves better now compare to when i first joined 4DMWC 2021 where it was my first ever tournament. It also helps me like manage time when to practice and not to over practice to avoid mindblocked on some map. So yeah the experience really helps me going into this one..</p>
<p><strong>Cryolien</strong>: For me, I've played in tournaments since 2014. This is just another day in the office. I'm immune to nerves
Basically whether it's a tournament setting or not, I'll pretty much be consistently scoring around the same as I would on any given day</p>
<p><strong>Einar</strong>: Just take it easy like me, if we win then we win (Nvm most of the time the one who tilted is me)</p>
<p><strong>So this is the 2nd time this country will be making it to the finals week. Obviously the last time this country made it this far was during your 2021 run that got Malaysia finished in 2nd place. Obviously, the growth of mania has evolved greatly for those of you that are in the tournament scene for a while now. Has the meta of this tournament changed your approach of how to approach each match, or has experience from years prior been a key to Malaysia's success for this year's tournament?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Einar</strong>: Tidur more lah bang (Sleep more bro)</p>
<p><strong>Cryolien</strong>: I wouldn't say we have a different approach, all we can really do is continue doing what we normally do and that's practicing 40 hours a day and go from there.</p>
<p><strong>StyGix</strong>: The level of difficulty definitely has increased by a lot but we do as usual, get highest score possible and we go from there</p>
<p><strong>JayLye</strong>: I'm not really sure to be honest, mostly I will do some analysis and practice a lot before each match starts.</p>
<p><strong>Tosai-</strong>: Especially for 4dm, the bar have definitely been set a lot higher every year, its honestly quite hard to prepare anything beforehand since we cannot gauge how hard the pool will be</p>
<p><strong>Einar</strong>: Jokes aside, as a captain i think all of them did really well so their own part.
Most of the time I'm the one who keeps telling them to just try to score highest at they can. Enjoy the game is the most important anyways (you guys better say agree) :)</p>
<p><strong>Cryolien</strong>: (no)</p>
<p><strong>Tosai-</strong>: Quitting the game is more important</p>
<p><strong>StyGix</strong>: Tidur is more important</p>
<p><strong>Man Einar, they must've hate you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JayLye</strong>: tidur buff</p>
<p><strong>Cryolien</strong>: jk thanks for captain</p>
<p><strong>Einar</strong>: Probably, cause i forcing them to play something they probably doesn’t comfort to play</p>
<p><strong>JayLye</strong>: But well yeah I do agree, enjoy the game is the most important.</p>
<p><strong>StyGix</strong>: Thanks for carry Jay. Love u :trollcat:</p>
<p><strong>Okay, one more question before I'll stop pressing you all with hard questions :trolleh:</strong></p>
<p><strong>So you guys are going into Finals week taking on Canada for the first Loser's Finals, and then on the conditional, Malaysia is potentially meeting Brazil or Hong Kong for the 3rd place battle. Any thoughts on your future opponents?</strong></p>
<p><strong>StyGix</strong>: Malaysia revenge arc starts this week</p>
<p><strong>JayLye</strong>: I will say there's gonna be more tough match coming up. But I will still try my best.</p>
<p><strong>StyGix</strong>: And probably revenge match against Brazil if we met each other again.</p>
<p>(Malaysia puts :Guil:)</p>
<p><strong>Cryolien</strong>: No thoughts, head empty
After seeing the performance that Canada put up against Singapore, I already feel like we need a skillboost to happen this week. Going up against Brazil or HK would also be a real challenge considering we already lost to Brazil once and HK is also a huge force to be reckoned with. But we'll just keep doing what we do and practice 40 hours a day (except SV, I will start learning that like 1 day before the match)</p>
<p><strong>Einar</strong>: We don’t have player like [LS]Byte, Maykee kee, or Misolato
But we’re try to give a shot to every opponent that we faced.
Even Semis on LB is not what I expect but at least we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>Cryolien</strong>: But we have JayLye!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>Tosai-</strong>: true, Jay will carry!</p>
<p><strong>StyGix</strong>: JayLyeGaming</p>
<p><strong>Einar</strong>: Please subscribe JayLye on Youtube, leave a like button and share out the video</p>
<p><strong>JayLye</strong>: :bonkeh:</p>
<p><strong>Alrighty, aside from that, thank you guys for taking this time for the interview! Best of luck to you all in the Finals week.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cryolien</strong>: Thanks, you too.</p>
<p><strong>JayLye</strong>: Thank you!</p>

<h2>Canada</h2>
<p><strong>How are you guys doing today?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Axelerrixx</strong>: BOGNYUR JEE MAPLE (🍁) ACKEOLQIUEIOS</p>
<p><strong>Svp-</strong>: I just woke up like 20 mins ago and missed the whole match :)</p>
<p><strong>Twitch Chat</strong>: I am doing well. woke up at 7am for a nice early osu mania session. I live in the land of cowboys and wheat fields</p>
<p><strong>AmariaLove</strong>: We are not doing that fine, we just lost to the most unfortunate series of events. As history has been written, by their victors, this moment will be reminded as a Singapore Victory. But from our perspective, We won.</p>
<p><strong>So it was a heartbreaking result for what you guys were expecting to accomplish. But it was a very close battle between you and the #1 seed Singapore. What was the mindset coming into the match against Singapore, and did you guys performed as expected for what you guys wanted to accomplish?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AmariaLove</strong>: To be honest, we thought it would be the easiest sweep for singapore. Also knowning that we would miss our Star player in the first 30/45 mins we went in just trolling, thinking there was no light at the end of the tunnel. Little did we know. There was. Jesus was there waiting for us. He gave us the reward of his faith. The rest is history.</p>
<p><strong>Axelerrixx</strong>: Honestly though, I thought that we would lose 6 - 3 at best, we did way better than I expected. Losing the tiebreaker hit hard though. (🍁)</p>
<p><strong>Twitch chat</strong>: I'm not gonna lie i wasn't expecting the match to be that close. At the start of the match we were missing axelerrixx and svp-, so we had to sub in AmariaRice for chordjack. Luckily axel started shredding as soon as he got home and Singapore avoided LN picks so svp being gone wasn't that big of an issue for us.</p>
<p><strong>Axelerrixx</strong>: I did not. My coat got caught on a chair when I got home and then I slipped.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of some players missing, was the time at 15:30 UTC being an issue for some players which could explain why Canada was missing their players during the tournament? Or was it external inconvenience that unfortunately happened to Axelerrixx &amp; svp-?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Twitch chat</strong>: 15:30 is really early for me personally. I woke up everyone in my house to play arrow game.</p>
<p><strong>Axelerrixx</strong>: I had volleyball practice (I hate volleyball I just need to lose weight) that ended at 15:30 UTC. I can't drive (I crashed car in forza horizon 8) so my father was to pick me up. He didn't pick me up (he was late). I also wasted six seconds because my coat got caught on a chair when I got home resulting in me having to go to the hospital (I was back after approximately 5.69 seconds though).</p>
<p><strong>Svp-</strong>: 15:30 UTC for the west coasters of the team (me)  is 7:30 am. Today, I woke up at 8:40am and immediately jumped into sv2 :l . So i guess time was a problem for me even thought i was the one who scheduled this match :skull:</p>
<p><strong>Twitch chat</strong>: it was the only time that worked though.</p>
<p><strong>Despite the loss, you guys looked very strong holding up to the best that Singapore has to offer. This does give you guys a lot of confidence that if everything works in your favor, Canada would be confident in getting to the Loser's Grand Finals then right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Axelerrixx</strong>: Certainly! Indeed! Absolutely! Without a doubt! Most definitely! Unquestionably! Undoubtedly! Of course! Agreed! Affirmative! By all means! Positively! Yup! Yeah! Yep! Right on! You bet! It is so! No problem! Definitely yes! Indubitably! Naturally! By all accounts! By all indications! Clearly! It's settled then! Most assuredly! Absolutely yes! Alright! Fine! Go ahead! By all means! Let's do it! I'm game! Yes, I concur! Yes, I consent! Yes, I assent! Yes, I approve! Yes, I accept! Yes, I acknowledge! Yes, I agree to! Yes, I comply with! Yes, I conciliate with! Yes, I subscribe to! Yes, I accede to! Yes, I am in accord with! Yes, I am in agreement with!</p>
<p><strong>AmariaLove</strong>: The winds of Fate blows wherever it wants. Only the braves will try to face it. Canada is a team that works together to go where we please. If we want to win, we will conquer. The voices will NOT win. We will show everyone (except if we face another asian team where we have to have a very bad scheduling which is very unlikely since every team are asians rn)  that we can bring it home. FOR THE MOTHERLAND.</p>
<p><strong>Twitch Chat</strong>: Yeah we think we have a pretty good chance, we just need to not get timezoned and start popping off.</p>
<p><strong>That might be a problem since Winner's Finals is an all Asia matchup. So I figured Grand Finals week is going to be hell for you guys to schedule with if that time does come for you guys.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AmariaLove</strong>: It really is hard. You know Pork, thing aside, we never get a good time from an asian team. Last year, we played at 5 AM for an Asian team. And even when we played at 5 AM, THEY STILL COMPLAINED. Last year, we did everything for these teams so they get a good time.</p>
<p><strong>Twitch chat</strong>: To be fair, teams like HK and Singapore are just really hard to schedule for. Both teams need to play at a bad time. It's what we get for being born in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>So lastly, it's now confirmed that Canada will be playing against Malaysia in the Loser's Finals. And waiting for you guys potentially is either Brazil or Hong Kong (the team that you guys knocked down in the first place). What is Canada's mindset now heading into the Loser's Finals week?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Twitch chat</strong>: Malaysia confirmed? I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>Yes. Malaysia won against Thailand a couple minutes before your match with Singapore happens. (6-1)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Svp-</strong>: We play game, win game, go home. but now we just gotta do it twice in losers bracket.</p>
<p><strong>Twitch chat</strong>: ^ We fought our way through losers last year we will do it again.</p>
<p><strong>AmariaLove</strong>: I think we would much prefer Hong Kong winning their loser's final match. For what it is from Malaysia. I think it's like playing Singapore but with a bit worse rice ability. We will see.</p>
<p><strong>And obviously last year, Canada came up short finishing in 4th place. Just 1 spot shy of the illustrious Top 3 finish. But regardless, Canada is still eyeing for the top prize right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AmariaLove</strong>: Yes we are. Always did. Always will.</p>
<p><strong>Twitch chat</strong>: I think if you go into any competitive setting not playing for 1st place you are doing it wrong.</p>
